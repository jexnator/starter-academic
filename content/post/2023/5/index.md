On Wednesday, we had the opportunity to participate in a Kubernetes (K8s) workshop led by Ashutosh and Samuel. Ashutosh started the session with a brief introduction to Kubernetes and its role in container orchestration. We then went deeper into Red Hat OpenShift, with Ashutosh giving an overview of the platform. Samuel then took over and demonstrated the OpenShift platform running locally in our internal lab on Nutanix. The workshop provided valuable insights into container management and how we can leverage these technologies in at our customers.

On Thursday, Gian and I had a training session with Dan about renewing the SSL certificate for our VPN tenant from Paloalto. During the session, we worked through the steps together and documented them so that everyone in internal IT could easily follow the process in the future.

After I completed some more internal IT tasks on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, we gathered for the monthly Amanox Lunch. During this event, Fabio shared his passion for simracing with us and introduced us to the exciting world of virtual motorsports.

To end the week, I attended the AWS session in the afternoon, which was followed by our Q1 info meeting.
