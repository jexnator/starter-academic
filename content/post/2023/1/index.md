After a few intense weeks I am now back via this blog. I wish you all a happy new year and I am looking forward to the coming year and of course to working with you.

For this year I plan to improve my presentation skills. Towards the end of the semester, I received a wake-up call from one of my lecturers about my presentation style. It said that I was very unconfident, unsteady and that it was unpleasant to have to listen to me 15 minutes at a time. In addition, my slides were too crammed with text and therefore too much of it was read off. As a tip, the following was mentioned: "Try to hold a part of the lecture in front of the WebCam and watch yourself, the goal would be to be able to radiate more confidence with more practice."
I must honestly say that this offended me a little. Granted, he's also partially right and I take the feedback to heart. However, it bothered me that this lecturer has the "best" presentation skills and his PVA's (lectures) are attended by 4/4 - 3/4 students. Professionally, he is top notch, but because of his presentation skills, he cannot pass on this knowledge. Due to this context and the fact that I have another module with this person in the next semester and again get a slot, I accept this challenge and do my best to rock this presentation with a lot of practice and conviction.

The only question that remains is how can I improve to convince the instructor otherwise?
On the one hand, I have personally noticed that the more people there are in the room, the more nervous I get. Since the beginning of my apprenticeship at Amanox, I have noticed that I can only solve this personal conflict through continuous presentation (practice gets you further) and that I should not try to avoid it. Furthermore, I should prepare myself better for the presentations and not just reinterpret or read out what I have written down on the slides. Until now, I have mostly relied on the freestyle principle.... This works very well in some cases, but it can also go wrong and lead to insecurity and restlessness. I also plan to work more with the media provided, such as the whiteboard, which allows me to graphically support my given statements and maybe can have a positive effect on the attention of the audience.

Towards the middle of December, before my vacations, I was still working on completing my term paper in the SWEM module. This work was about applying the strategies and models learned from the module to the creation of a specification for a fictitious software. I chose a VideoLibrarySoftware (VBS) that helps the user to organize and manage large video libraries locally on a computer via a GUI.

After my very relaxing vacations in Prague and parallel caffeine withdrawal, I sat down with fresh energy and new momentum to my first transfer paper in which I reported on the topic "IaC: AWS CDK vs Terraform in use at an IT service provider". Admittedly, the work turned out to be crap in my opinion, because I formulated the questioning too openly and thus kept the work too general / too slimmed down. Also the dear ChatGPT could not give me an answer to the question: "How can I save my ass and build up a scientific paper as good as possible, where the questioning was kept too open / too general? - unfortunately also could not give me a target-oriented answer. However, after these facts and the helpful Feedback, I now fortunately know what I should put my eye marrow on for the next TA.

In the next two weeks I put some more time into the module exam preparation and in parallel spent a bit too much in front of the XBOX @Amanox. In the latter aspect, I would like to limit the consumption in the future, because the resulting context change, negatively affects my efficiency and time management. However, it is worth mentioning that gaming does not only have a negative effect on me, but also creates a good balance during the stressful exam preparation time. Gits eine?

I am mostly satisfied with my performance at the exams and I am curious to see if my prediction is true, which will become apparent in a few weeks.

I am now moving forward internally with the AWS CloudWatch module and some accumulated improvement tasks to the BI tool.

Cheers,
Xavier
