In the first week Dan and I set about the task of cleaning up our IT room, which had been out of order for a long time. Not only did we clean out and tidy up the room, but we also set new rules for how the room should be used. By the end of the day, the room looked neat and well organized, and the desired result was achieved.
The next day, I set up an account for our future marketing team member and upgraded an older laptop to Windows 11 using a bypass method. In between, I completed some tasks on the internal IT mailbox board and reviewed, AWS costs and placed an order with Digitec.
On Friday, Gian and I worked together to set up the Rubrik Polaris Backup for our organization's O365 tenant. In the afternoon, we tried to configure the Single Sign-On (SSO) according to the documentation provided. Unfortunately, we ran into some issues and were unable to complete the setup. We may need to contact Rubric Support to resolve the issue.
Based on Dan's feedback, Gian and I will need to reconfigure the backup solution by creating a separate Global Admin account specifically for backups. This change will ensure security and separation and prevent the entire system from depending on a single root Global Admin account.
I made also some progress in the second week, both in my studies and at work.
At the beginning of the week, I made final changes to the disposition for my transfer paper and spent some time searching for the appropriate literature for the paper.
In internal IT, I was busy completing a few tasks. One of them was to install new USB-C hubs in the meeting rooms so that we have a standardized interface, both for macOS and Windows users, and don't have to connect an additional power supply to the devices for charging.
Together with my colleague Gian, I also changed the globaladmin account for the Polaris Backup rubric. Based on Dan's feedback, we reconfigured the backup solution and created a separate Global Admin account specifically for backup. This change will help increase the security of the system and avoid the dependency on the root Global Admin account.
I also attended the AWS Meetup, where I was able to listen to a number of presentations, including one on AWS Appsync. It was an interesting experience, especially the sharing and apero afterwards.
Finally, on Saturday, I participated in the Grandprix in Bern with some work colleagues. The 16km run was challenging, but I made it. However, I had a considerable muscle soreness in the days to come... :-D
