### Week 1
In our PiBS studies we complete a communication module in which we focus on our personal appearance and intercultural skills. The practical part of this module includes a 3-day course in a Ticino theater school, which we were able to attend as a class this week.

On Tuesday evening, we set off as a class to Verscio. Verscio is a small village below the Maggia Valley. We arrived in Locarno around 8am and then took a bus to Avegno - a village right next to Verscio, where we checked into our bungalows at the Picolo Paradiso campground for the next 3 days.

The next morning we took the Centovali Express to Verscio to the theater school "Accademia Teatro Dimitri" where we were welcomed by our director of studies together with the two course leaders Hans-Henning and Diego.

The first day was mainly about getting to know each other better and finding out how far you can go personally until you leave your comfort zone.

During the second day, we were shown and taught that before communicating with another person, it is important to first establish a connection with them and maintain it throughout the dialogue.

The third day was mainly about acting out what we had learned in small theater sequences and reflecting on how we personally (internally) feel as a performer and how the whole thing is viewed by the audience from the outside (externally).

The exercises we did during the course were very different. Partly we were on a mat and in my opinion we did a kind of yoga, where Hans-Henning navigated us through. Partly we did exercises together in a big circle, partly we put ourselves in the position of a water plant and had to move or dance like one, partly the exercises were of a sportive nature and as already mentioned, we also did theater sequences.

I could not always understand what exactly we were doing in certain exercises and in what way this should help us as students in our daily work. Personally, I think that the course instructors, due to their experience in the theater sector, have completely different views of life and are sometimes also a bit more spiritual than people in the IT sector. Nevertheless, the workshop was fun and I was able to draw some lessons from it regarding personal appearance during a dialogue or a communication such as body posture, eye contact and presentation technique.

A very positive side effect was also the strengthening of class cohesion. I think that through the workshop and the free time in between, we really got to know each other for the first time and, above all, got into closer contact with people with whom we normally didn't have much to do.

All in all - a somewhat different, but successful and interesting working week.

### Week 2
This week started with creating the O365 account for a new sales person. This included capturing the data in Azure AD, adding the correct groups, applications and licenses. The next step was to create the Hubspot account.

This week Fabian, Nino, Gianluca and I were involved in the IT migration. On Thursday, this allowed us to participate in a first messaging migration workshop conducted by our French Vinci Energies colleagues. 

During the rest of the time I worked on the CloudSec module, finalizing it and filling in the feedback form accordingly. The learnings in module can be found in the publication "Cloud Security in AWS". Then on Friday I started with the theory of IaC&DevOps with Terraform module, in which I was taught the basics of DevOps in the "Day 1" chapter. This included the term definition of DevOps, meaning Development + Operations. Additionally, I am now aware of what DevOps encompasses for Keyconcepst and what opportunities arise from it such as CI/CD, IaC, Microservices and improvements in communication, collaboration and monitoring & logging. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into the topic and the diversity of the module as it was written by different coaches or staff and thus written from different perspectives.

By the way - this week we were in Croatia in the Workation. I shared my isights about it with Rebecca, who posted a post about it including a video on LinkedIn.
