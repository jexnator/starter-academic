During the first week of this period we were at the Amanox Skiweekend in Diablerets. It was a very successful event despite the bad weather.

During the second week I was busy with our internal IT mailbox. Since we are several employees using the mailbox, it is not always easy to see who exactly does and has done what. This made it difficult to manage the mailbox. I then came up with a solution to this problem. The goal for me was to keep the solution as simple and cheap as possible. I first looked on the Internet, as we were certainly not the only ones who had this problem up to that point. I then came across some third-party solutions, but they would all generate additional costs. I then did some more research with the criterion of solving the problem myself using Microsoft services. This is how I came across Microsoft Power Automate.

It occurred to me that we could create a Kanban board in Microsoft Planner where we could access the mailbox tasks. I then set up a flow with Microsoft Power Automate that creates a new task with the content of the mail whenever a mail is flagged in the mailbox. So we now have the ability to create tasks from mails. The members of the internal IT can now create tasks when they discover a potential job in the mailbox. Afterwards, you can always view the Kanban board and assign tasks to yourself, which you can then also set a time limit for. This way it is easier to see who is doing what and there is no redundant work.

During the rest of the time I worked on the CloudMonitoring module.

This week I finished the module, created and held the presentation and filled out the feedback form. I also worked on some internal IT tasks.

Next week I will start with the next internal module "CloudSecurity" from Anda. I am excited to see what will await me.
