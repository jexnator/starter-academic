At the beginning of this two weeks, I completed the setup of the Microsoft accounts for Rebecca and Tobias in AzureAD. This involved creating their accounts and ensuring they had the necessary access and permissions.
Following that, I had an introductory session with Rebecca where we went through the setup of her laptop. Together, we configured her device and I provided her with an overview of the essential functionalities and tools relevant to her work. My goal was to equip her with the knowledge and skills that she can begin her daily work @Amanox smoothly.
During a support call with Rubrik, I collaborated with a Customer Success Engineer to address an error scenario related to the Single Sign-On integration of Rubrik Polaris. Despite our efforts, we have not yet received any helpful feedback, and thus the case remains open.
To ensure the smooth operation of our Rubrik backup for the Microsoft 365 tenant, I created a detailed document outlining the current configurations in Rubrik Polaris. This document also included instructions on how to access the portal and an explanation of the capabilities of the Bronze SLA-domain that we selected.
In addition, Gian and I collaborated on creating a comprehensive documentation for various recovery scenarios and on-demand snapshots for our Rubrik Backup. This guide will help our internal IT team to perform restore scenarios in the event of data loss
To validate the effectiveness of the documentation we created, I conducted rigorous testing of the restore scenarios. Thankfully, everything worked as intended, confirming the reliability and accuracy of our recovery procedures.
As part of the preparations for our quarterly meeting, I took created the presentation slides that highlight the capabilities of our Rubrik Secure Cloud Subscription for Microsoft 365. These slides aim to show the advantages and features of our subscription to the employees.
On Friday was the monthly bilateral talk with Dan and the internal IT meeting.
