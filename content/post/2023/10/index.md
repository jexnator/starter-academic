At the beginning of the week I finished Microsoft accounts for Rebecca and Tobias in AzureAD.
Afterwards, the introduction with Rebecca was on the agenda. I set up the laptop together with her and showed her the most important functionalities and tools that are relevant for her work. I hope that this will enable her to start her daily work with Amanox in an easy way.
In a support call with Rubrik, together with a Customer-Sucess-Engineer, I addressed the error scenario related to the SSO integration of Rubrik Polaris. Unfortunately, I have not received any helpful feedback to date, so the case remains open.
For our Rubrik backup of the Microsoft 365 tenant, I created a document that shows the current configurations in Rubrik Polaris, how to access the portal and what the Bronze SLA domain we chose is capable of.
In addition, Gian and I created detailed documentation on recovery scenarios and on-demand snapshots for our Rubrik Backup. This guide allows internal IT to perform restore scenarios in case of data loss.
I then tested out the restore scenarios using the documentation created, which so far everything worked as intended.
As part of the preparations for our quarterly meeting, I created presentation slides highlighting the capabilities of our Secure Cloud Subscription rubric in conjunction with Microsoft 365.
Friday was the monthly bilateral talk with Dan and the internal IT meeting.
