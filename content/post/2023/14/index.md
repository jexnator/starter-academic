New spaces have recently been set up in our office that can be used for telephone calls, focused work or as a quiet retreat. Gianluca and Dan have organized the necessary hardware for these rooms. On Wednesday, after final completion and acceptance, Gian and I equipped the three rooms with tables, chairs and the necessary equipment and hardware. After setting up, we moved unused items that had accumulated during the construction work into the cellar. Once there, Gian, Adha and I took the opportunity to tidy up a bit, as it had become a bit messy in our cellar in the meantime.

In between, I re-configured ROOMZ so that an overview of the daily meeting room usage is visible on the displays, as before.

On Thursday and Friday, I worked on my transfer paper for this semester about the recently completed IT migration and its impact on the existing zero-trust policy at Amanox.

Friday afternoon was the migration weekly. Afterwards, I carried out some tests with Alessandro regarding MFA, tested the external sharing topic with Gian and finally wrote this blog ;-)

All in all, once again a somewhat quieter but successful week. Cheers and have a nice weekend, Xavier
