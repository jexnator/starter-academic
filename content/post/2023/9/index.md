Over the last two weeks I have been working on my transfer paper. The central question is: "Which current GUI libraries, design patterns, and best practices are most relevant for developing a C#-based GUI desktop application?"

My goal is to identify the most relevant and effective technologies, architectures, and design patterns to provide a sound basis for the subsequent design and development of a GUI desktop application. This work is intended to provide value to both me, the student, and the company.

The reason for this work is that we would like to develop a small GUI desktop application in C# to allow back office employees to block and manage spam numbers that come to the company's main number themselves. Currently, a member of the internal IT staff always has to log on to the MS Teams tenant via the CLI in PowerShell and block the numbers. This leads to additional overhead as the process involves multiple people and email traffic. By developing this application, we hope to reduce this overhead and make the process more efficient.

I am still finalizing the work in private. Most of the work has been written. What is still missing is the synthesis of the knowledge gained from the literature.
