The last free weeks I worked on different topics. On Friday the 17.02 a content creator from our school the FFHS came over to shoot a commercial for Socialmedia with Gian and me. Furthermore, I did some internal-IT tasks, including various AWS Lab things or preparing for the on-boarding of the new employees. I communicated with Nino for this. He took his time to introduce me and instruct me in the onboarding & offboarding process (Thanks Nino :-).

In between I had a week of vacation which I used to recover. Despite the fact that there was little snow in Valais, my colleague and I did some other sports. We went to Crans-Montana and stretched there a Highline (Slackline). Afterwards, we spent almost every day on our midline, which was noticed at the end of the week by a severe muscle ache.

After my vacations, we continued with the on-boarding of our new teammates together with Nino. So far, everything went according to plan. At noon, we all went out for pizza together at Celina.
The rest of the week I was busy with the internal CloudWatch module.
