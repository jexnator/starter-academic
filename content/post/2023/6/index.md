During these three weeks I was on vacation except for two days.

On 04/04 I was allowed to sit in on two interviews for PiBS and give the applicants some information about the training at the school and at Amanox. In the end none of the candidates really fit to the Amanox :-(

On 18/04 I finished my disposition for the transfer work. In the afternoon the disposition meeting with my school supervisor and Dan about the transfer work took place.
