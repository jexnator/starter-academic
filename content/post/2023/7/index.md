At the beginning of the week, I revised the layout of my transfer work based on the valuable feedback I received from Dan and Sven during the disposition meeting last week. 

As the week progressed, we encountered a synchronization issue with our BI tool. I took the time to analyze the issue and was subsequently able to resolve it by increasing the execution time of the VM.

In addition to fixing the problem with the BI tool, I completed several internal IT tasks. One of these tasks was to set up a ring call for Christian, reserve a sipcall number and make the necessary adjustments to our Microsoft Teams tenant. Gian and I also had a short session renewing the AWS SSO SAML certificate and documenting each step of the process to ensure reproducibility.

Friday proved to be a day full of meetings. We started with the overall team meeting, followed by the Amanox Lab team meeting. During the monthly Amanox lunch, we had the opportunity to listen to Dominik give us a presentation about his disease, diabetes. This was very exciting and enlightening. In the afternoon, an AWS session was on the agenda. At the end of the day we had the pleasure to get to know Till - a PiBS student colleague of mine - better.
