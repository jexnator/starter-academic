In the second week we started with our first intern modul. Dan and Jim were the coaches of the hardware modul. The goal was to get knowledge about all hardware parts in a personal computer, notebook or a server. This includes also the princips, how the different parts are working and how they communicate together.<br>

We learned that hardware contains different parts of a computer, which can work internal or external in a device. An important part of this was to understand the basic principle of data storage. It was exciting to get an insight into the computer language. The binary code consists of a 1 or a 0 and occupies exactly one bit. With this knowhow we had to do serveral task, which you can see in my publication ["Hardware"](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/).<br>

Also interesting was the task of assembling my own computer on the Digitec platform. In the next step, we had to apply the theory we had learned in practice and assemble a PC with the hardware, which was provided by our company. Unfortunately, not all parts were in our company by then, so we had to postpone this. However, I look forward to making up for this in the future.<br>

By the way our supervisor Dan showed us the hole building in which our company is located. Know we are informed where we have to go, when we feel the need to compete in a ping pong tournament or take a short power nap. On the top of the building is a nice terrace, where you have a beautiful view over Bern.<br>

So far, I am very satisfied with our journey @Amanox Solutions. If you have any questions or uncertainties, you can always contact a coach or employee and count on their support. You also notice that the coaches put a lot of effort into creating the modules to guarantee a varied learning experience.<br>
