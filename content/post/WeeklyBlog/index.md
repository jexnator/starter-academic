In the second week we started with our first intern modul. Dan and Jim were the coaches of the hardware modul. The goal was to get knowledge about all hardware parts in a personal computer, notebook or a server. This includes also the princips, how the different parts are working and how they communicate together.<br>

We learned that hardware contains different parts of a computer, which can work internal or external in a device. An important part of this was to understand the basic principle of data storage. It was exciting to get an insight into the computer language. The binary code consists of a 1 or a 0 and occupies exactly one bit. With this knowhow we had to do serveral task, which you can see in my publication [Hardware](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/).<br>

Also interesting was the task of assembling my own computer on the Digitec platform. In the next step, we had to apply the theory we had learned in practice and assemble a PC with the hardware, which was provided by our company. Unfortunately, not all parts were in our company by then, so we had to postpone this. However, I look forward to making up for this in the future.<br>

By the way our supervisor Dan showed us the hole building in which our company is located. Know we are informed where we have to go, when we feel the need to compete in a ping pong tournament or take a short power nap. On the top of the building is a nice terrace, where you have a beautiful view over Bern.<br>

So far, I am very satisfied with our journey @Amanox Solutions. If you have any questions or uncertainties, you can always contact a coach or employee and count on their support. You also notice that the coaches put a lot of effort into creating the modules to guarantee a varied learning experience.<br>

### @School
On Monday we had our first school day @FFHS. The school is located in the "Welle 7" building at the central station of Bern. The various modules take place every two weeks.<br>

In a first session we had the modules:<br>
● Project Management<br>
● Java Fundamentals<br>
● Discrete Mathematics<br>

In every single module we were informed about the exact schedule of the semester. Afterwards, we were allowed to ask questions regarding the preparation and clarify ambiguities. Afterwards, we usually had time to do some exercises together with the lecturers.<br>

Basically, the same principle in every module applies:<br>
● Preparation at home<br>
● face-to-face teaching at school<br>
● Postprocessing at home<br>

Already on the first day I had to determine that the preperation at home is very important. If you don't prepare you, you can't follow during the presence classes sessions.
I am very satisfied with the first day of school. The location is technically very well equipped and you have also good catering options nearby.<br>

On Tuesday, our free provided day, I started with the Postprocessing Session from Monday at home. In the afternoon I still had time to focus on the next schoolday.<br>

### @Work
On Wendesday till Friday I followed Jim's [Hardware Module](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/). The goal was to get knowledge about the different hardware parts in depth. This included also the  exact mode of operation of a CPU. For this part i used the Johnny Simulator to simulate how a CPU performs calculations. The Addition and subtraction calculation is working quite easily, while multiplication requires several program steps including a loop until the counter is set to zero.

After the Johnny Simulator session I got acquainted with the program cheatengine. The goal was to manipulate a score. This was a quite interesting task.

Looking back, it was a very instructive week. I think that this prior knowledge will certainly benefit us for the subject Fundamentals of Computer Engineering. I have heared that we will use the Johnny Simulator also at School.

### @School
On Monday, we had our second school day @FFHS.<br>

The remaining modules on Monday were:<br>
● Web Fundamentals<br>
● Basics of technical Informatics<br>

The second school day was also very interesting. I think that we got very competent lecturers for the subjects WebF an BtI.

It should be mentioned that Yonea and I have to take the additional module linear algebra on this Saturday afternoon (every last Saturday of the month), because we do not own a gymnasium diploma.

### @Work
At our company I continued with Jim's Hardware Module. We focused us on HDD's & SSD's in detail.
The goal was to find out the different grades of this storage devices. For example, WD storage media distinguishes the different grades with colors, which I have not noticed before.
After that I started to develope the different types of interfaces. I learned, that you distinguish between internal and exterenal interfaces. More tasks you will find [here](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/).

On Thursday i prepared me for the last task in the module. It is about creating a presentation, where we deepen ourselves in a learned topic from the module. I have chosen the topic of optical disk storage.
I tried to visualize the PowerPoint presentation with the help of the Wacom pen display, that we received from the school. This was a good exercise, because we will need this devive in the future.
![Wacom](wacom.jpg "<b>Wacom Pad |</b> Unsplash: Szabo Viktor")
On Friday morning, I gave my presentation the final touches. Then at 11:15 AM I held my presentation about optical "disk storage". The presentation did not go badly, but I think that I focused me a little bit too much on the visual aspect of the slides than on the preperation. I also need to improve my english skills.
Jim and John gave me some constructive feedback, that I plan to implement in future presentations. The slides of the presentation you will find {{% staticref "uploads/slides.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.

This week Yonea an me learned how an offer should look like. First we got some theorie inputs about how to write an offer correctly. Then I started with the first task. The goal was to create two PC offers for Yonea with her personal requirements including the desired budget. She was looking for a gamer pc with associated peripherals. I tried to configurate the two PCs on my own, how we learned it in the hardware modul. During this I had to realize that creating an offer can be difficult, if you would match all requirements depending on the price.<br>

Yonea did also the same for me. I searched a portable workstation for CAD and CAM softwares, which I can use in the office and also in a production environment.
After that we discused our founded solutions together and decided us for the preferred hardware.<br>

The next thing was to explore the versioning tool Git. The tool is absolutely important if multiple programmes work together on the similar project. After I readed trough the theorie block, I started with the first task.
The goal was to create a new repository on Github, to clone it to your local folder, to create a new branch and merge it then to the master branch. By the way Rafael Wicht gave me some important advices and illustrated them with some practical examples on Github.<br>
![Github](github.jpg "<b>Github |</b> Unsplash: Yancy Min")
The next step was to do some collaboration task together with Yonea, to understand what a merge conflict is. I created a new repository on Github and added Yonea as a collaborator. On Github you have the possibility to give different access roles:<br>

> ● `Read`: for non-code contributors, read-only accsess<br>
● `Triage`: for contributors who need to manage issues and pull requests without write access<br>
● `Write`: for contributors who write and push code to the repository<br>
● `Maintain`: that's a typical role for a project manager who need to manage the repository, without sensitive or destructive actions<br>
● `Admin`: for people who have full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions<br>

Each of us created a personal branch. Then we worked on the same file and tried to merge our branches to the master. So there we had our first merge conflict ⬇️.<br>
![Merge conflict](mergeconflict.jpg "<b>Merge Conflict |</b> Screenshot")
In this situation you should talk to each other and find a solution, which is fine for all involved developers. This task gave me an idea of how to work with Git in a collaboration space. Git is a very useful tool and we will certainly need it a lot in the future.<br>

"Let's get ready with Python"<br>
In the sixth week of our journey we started with the module python. After the download of the python IDLE, I wrote my first "Hello World" programm to check if everything went fine. Then I got in touch with the syntax rules of python. I was very suprised if I heared that we don't need to declare a block of code with "{ }"-brackets or don't need to show up the end of a line with a ";"-semicolon. The next thing was to learn the two solutions how you can write a comment. Also important was to get knowledge about the datastructure in python. The data structure includes two Datatypes. I learned about the different primitive types and the non-primitive Types. It was interesting to apply the many methods to the respective data type.<br>

On Tuesday and Wednesday I continued with the python module. Then Yonea and me got a call from John. He informed us, that we have to organize the trial week from Emma Vögeli. Emma is a 14 years old girl and would like to get more knowledge about our profession. After that, Yonea and I tried to come up with a plan for what we would like to show Emma over the next week. It was all a bit short notice, but at the end we were able to put an acceptable program together. We planned the following workshops for the following week:<br>

`Monday`: On next Monday Emma come with us to the school, to get an insight of our study.<br>
`Tuesday`: For Tuesday Morning we planned a short presentation about our company and our services. In the afternoon I would like to show Emma something about the programming language Python.<br>
`Wednesday`: On Wednesday Yonea planned an introduction about HTML and CSS.<br>
`Thursday`: On Thursday Yonea and me are out of office because our 60% ratio. We asked our coworker Kiru and Jim to do some workshops with Emma. Kiru would like to show Emma something about Virtual-Machines and Jim does a workshop with the Rasperry Pi.<br>
`Friday`: On Friday Morning we planed a short review with Emma about the trial week. In the afternoon we have the possibility to join Rubén and Armstrong to view how they install some new nodes in the datacenter<br>


In this week i learned how to manage some short-term tasks. John explained us that this can be very normal in the IT. I think that Yonea and I did not a bad job.<br>

<p align="justify">
On Monday Yonea and me met us as discussed with Emma at 08:30 at the entrance of Welle 7. Then we visited together the subject WebG. I think it was a well opportunity for Emma to see how it's inside of our study.<br>

### @Work
For the rest of the week we have arranged with Emma that she can be in the office at 10:00 AM each day.<br>

On Tuesday morning we showed Emma our company in detail. Rafael Wicht did a short introduction of the areas of activity of our job. After that I started with my workshop. I demonstrated Emma the basics of the program language Python. I tried to bring in some programming tasks, where she can playfully learn, how to write programs with Python. Emma seemed very interested and asked questions diligently. As a last point I provided Emma some useful links, if she is interested in Python programming in the future. At the end oft the day I was quite happy about my short workshop.<br>

The next day, Yonea showed Emma how to design a website using HTML and CSS. While this I focussed me on the intern python module. I learned about state machines and algorithms. There are two different types of state machines and they can be determenistic and non-deterministic. Deterministic means that only one Statechange of a specific character can be performed, while by non-deterministic statemachines multiple statechanges with the same character are possible. I did serveral tasks about the topic, where i had to draw statemachines or to decide whether a statemachine is derterministic or non-deterministic.<br>

On Thursday I had my free day, which i used to prepare me for the next school session.<br>

The following day, Yonea and I did a review of the trial week together with Emma. In the afternoon we had the possibilty to see our companys datacenter together with Armstrong and Rubén. They assembled and installed four new nodes in the lab.<br>
For me it was very interesting, because I have never been able to see a datacenter from this close up. In case of questions or uncertainties, Rubén and Armstrong were very helpful and informed us in great detail.<br>

## 28/09/21 - 30/09/21
### @Work
This week I continued working on the Python module.<br>

I learned about conditions and loops. Now I'm able to write an "if: else:" statement. Furthermore I practiced how to use for-, foreach- and while loops correctly. It was fundamental to ecxercice on different tasks, to obtain a solid base of the theorie. Until now is stored all the previous files local on my notebook. If it's necessary, i have the possibilty to have a look to this files, when something recurring is not directly clear. I also recommend W3-Schools, if you have questions regarding programming languages.<br>

The next thing was to learn how to iterate trough a list or an array using a for loop. For this I used the different return possibilities "return" & "yield". Another important part of this week, was to understand how object oriented programming works in Python.<br>

On Thursday Yonea had her last day at our company. We became a very good PiBS-team in the meantime. I think it is a great pity that she has ended the journey with this, but that is life. I wish her the best for the future and I think that we will surely run into each other sometime.<br>
