In the second week we started with our first intern modul. Dan and Jim were the coaches of the hardware modul. The goal was to get knowledge about all hardware parts in a personal computer, notebook or a server. This includes also the princips, how the different parts are working and how they communicate together.<br>

We learned that hardware contains different parts of a computer, which can work internal or external in a device. An important part of this was to understand the basic principle of data storage. It was exciting to get an insight into the computer language. The binary code consists of a 1 or a 0 and occupies exactly one bit. With this knowhow we had to do serveral task, which you can see in my publication ["Hardware"](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/).<br>

Also interesting was the task of assembling my own computer on the Digitec platform. In the next step, we had to apply the theory we had learned in practice and assemble a PC with the hardware, which was provided by our company. Unfortunately, not all parts were in our company by then, so we had to postpone this. However, I look forward to making up for this in the future.<br>

By the way our supervisor Dan showed us the hole building in which our company is located. Know we are informed where we have to go, when we feel the need to compete in a ping pong tournament or take a short power nap. On the top of the building is a nice terrace, where you have a beautiful view over Bern.<br>

So far, I am very satisfied with our journey @Amanox Solutions. If you have any questions or uncertainties, you can always contact a coach or employee and count on their support. You also notice that the coaches put a lot of effort into creating the modules to guarantee a varied learning experience.<br>

### @School
On Monday we had our first school day @FFHS. The school is located in the "Welle 7" at the central station of Bern. The various modules take place every two weeks.<br>

In a first session we had the modules:<br>
● Project Management<br>
● Java Fundamentals<br>
● Discrete Mathematics<br>

In every single module we were informed about the exact schedule of the semester. Afterwards, we were allowed to ask questions regarding the preparation and clarify ambiguities. Afterwards, we usually had time to do some exercises together with the lecturers.<br>

Basically, the same principle in every module applies:<br>
● Preparation at home<br>
● face-to-face teaching at school<br>
● Postprocessing at home<br>

Already on the first day I had to determine that the preperation at home is very important. If you don't prepare you, you can't follow during the presence classes sessions.
I am very satisfied with the first day of school. The location is technically very well equipped and you have also good catering options nearby.<br>

On Tuesday, our free provided day, I started with the Postprocessing Session from Monday at home. In the afternoon I still had time to focus on the next schoolday.<br>
