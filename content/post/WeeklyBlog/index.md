In the second week we started with our first intern modul. Dan and Jim were the coaches of the hardware modul. The goal was to get knowledge about all hardware parts in a personal computer, notebook or a server. This includes also the princips, how the different parts are working and how they communicate together.<br>

We learned that hardware contains different parts of a computer, which can work internal or external in a device. An important part of this was to understand the basic principle of data storage. It was exciting to get an insight into the computer language. The binary code consists of a 1 or a 0 and occupies exactly one bit. With this knowhow we had to do serveral task, which you can see in my publication [Hardware](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/).<br>

Also interesting was the task of assembling my own computer on the Digitec platform. In the next step, we had to apply the theory we had learned in practice and assemble a PC with the hardware, which was provided by our company. Unfortunately, not all parts were in our company by then, so we had to postpone this. However, I look forward to making up for this in the future.<br>

By the way our supervisor Dan showed us the hole building in which our company is located. Know we are informed where we have to go, when we feel the need to compete in a ping pong tournament or take a short power nap. On the top of the building is a nice terrace, where you have a beautiful view over Bern.<br>

So far, I am very satisfied with our journey @Amanox Solutions. If you have any questions or uncertainties, you can always contact a coach or employee and count on their support. You also notice that the coaches put a lot of effort into creating the modules to guarantee a varied learning experience.<br>

### @School
On Monday we had our first school day @FFHS. The school is located in the "Welle 7" building at the central station of Bern. The various modules take place every two weeks.<br>

In a first session we had the modules:<br>
● Project Management<br>
● Java Fundamentals<br>
● Discrete Mathematics<br>

In every single module we were informed about the exact schedule of the semester. Afterwards, we were allowed to ask questions regarding the preparation and clarify ambiguities. Afterwards, we usually had time to do some exercises together with the lecturers.<br>

Basically, the same principle in every module applies:<br>
● Preparation at home<br>
● face-to-face teaching at school<br>
● Postprocessing at home<br>

Already on the first day I had to determine that the preperation at home is very important. If you don't prepare you, you can't follow during the presence classes sessions.
I am very satisfied with the first day of school. The location is technically very well equipped and you have also good catering options nearby.<br>

On Tuesday, our free provided day, I started with the Postprocessing Session from Monday at home. In the afternoon I still had time to focus on the next schoolday.<br>
![School](school.jpg "<b>School |</b> Unsplash: Scott Graham")

### @Work
On Wendesday till Friday I followed Jim's [Hardware Module](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/). The goal was to get knowledge about the different hardware parts in depth. This included also the  exact mode of operation of a CPU. For this part i used the Johnny Simulator to simulate how a CPU performs calculations. The Addition and subtraction calculation is working quite easily, while multiplication requires several program steps including a loop until the counter is set to zero.

After the Johnny Simulator session I got acquainted with the program cheatengine. The goal was to manipulate a score. This was a quite interesting task.

Looking back, it was a very instructive week. I think that this prior knowledge will certainly benefit us for the subject Fundamentals of Computer Engineering. I have heared that we will use the Johnny Simulator also at School.
</p><br>

## 23/08/21 - 27/08/21
<p align="justify">

### @School
On Monday, we had our second school day @FFHS.<br>

The remaining modules on Monday were:<br>
● Web Fundamentals<br>
● Basics of technical Informatics<br>

The second school day was also very interesting. I think that we got very competent lecturers for the subjects WebF an BtI.

It should be mentioned that Yonea and I have to take the additional module linear algebra on this Saturday afternoon (every last Saturday of the month), because we do not own a gymnasium diploma.

### @Work
At our company I continued with Jim's Hardware Module. We focused us on HDD's & SSD's in detail.
The goal was to find out the different grades of this storage devices. For example, WD storage media distinguishes the different grades with colors, which I have not noticed before.
After that I started to develope the different types of interfaces. I learned, that you distinguish between internal and exterenal interfaces. More tasks you will find [here](https://xavierjeiziner.netlify.app/publication/module-hardware/).

On Thursday i prepared me for the last task in the module. It is about creating a presentation, where we deepen ourselves in a learned topic from the module. I have chosen the topic of optical disk storage.
I tried to visualize the PowerPoint presentation with the help of the Wacom pen display, that we received from the school. This was a good exercise, because we will need this devive in the future.
![Wacom](wacom.jpg "<b>Wacom Pad |</b> Unsplash: Szabo Viktor")
On Friday morning, I gave my presentation the final touches. Then at 11:15 AM I held my presentation about optical "disk storage". The presentation did not go badly, but I think that I focused me a little bit too much on the visual aspect of the slides than on the preperation. I also need to improve my english skills.
Jim and John gave me some constructive feedback, that I plan to implement in future presentations. The slides of the presentation you will find {{% staticref "uploads/slides.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.

<p align="justify">
This week Yonea an me learned how an offer should look like. First we got some theorie inputs about how to write an offer correctly. Then I started with the first task. The goal was to create two PC offers for Yonea with her personal requirements including the desired budget. She was looking for a gamer pc with associated peripherals. I tried to configurate the two PCs on my own, how we learned it in the hardware modul. During this I had to realize that creating an offer can be difficult, if you would match all requirements depending on the price.<br>

Yonea did also the same for me. I searched a portable workstation for CAD and CAM softwares, which I can use in the office and also in a production environment.
After that we discused our founded solutions together and decided us for the preferred hardware.<br>

The next thing was to explore the versioning tool Git. The tool is absolutely important if multiple programmes work together on the similar project. After I readed trough the theorie block, I started with the first task.
The goal was to create a new repository on Github, to clone it to your local folder, to create a new branch and merge it then to the master branch. By the way Rafael Wicht gave me some important advices and illustrated them with some practical examples on Github.<br>
![Github](github.jpg "<b>Github |</b> Unsplash: Yancy Min")
The next step was to do some collaboration task together with Yonea, to understand what a merge conflict is. I created a new repository on Github and added Yonea as a collaborator. On Github you have the possibility to give different access roles:<br>

> ● `Read`: for non-code contributors, read-only accsess<br>
● `Triage`: for contributors who need to manage issues and pull requests without write access<br>
● `Write`: for contributors who write and push code to the repository<br>
● `Maintain`: that's a typical role for a project manager who need to manage the repository, without sensitive or destructive actions<br>
● `Admin`: for people who have full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions<br>

Each of us created a personal branch. Then we worked on the same file and tried to merge our branches to the master. So there we had our first merge conflict ⬇️.<br>
![Merge conflict](mergeconflict.jpg "<b>Merge Conflict |</b> Screenshot")
In this situation you should talk to each other and find a solution, which is fine for all involved developers. This task gave me an idea of how to work with Git in a collaboration space. Git is a very useful tool and we will certainly need it a lot in the future.<br>

"Let's get ready with Python"<br>
In the sixth week of our journey we started with the module python. After the download of the python IDLE, I wrote my first "Hello World" programm to check if everything went fine. Then I got in touch with the syntax rules of python. I was very suprised if I heared that we don't need to declare a block of code with "{ }"-brackets or don't need to show up the end of a line with a ";"-semicolon. The next thing was to learn the two solutions how you can write a comment. Also important was to get knowledge about the datastructure in python. The data structure includes two Datatypes. I learned about the different primitive types and the non-primitive Types. It was interesting to apply the many methods to the respective data type.<br>

![Python](python.jpg "<b>Python |</b> Unsplash: Davide Clode")

## 15/09/21 - 17/09/21
<p align="justify">
On Tuesday and Wednesday I continued with the python module. Then Yonea and me got a call from John. He informed us, that we have to organize the trial week from Emma Vögeli. Emma is a 14 years old girl and would like to get more knowledge about our profession. After that, Yonea and I tried to come up with a plan for what we would like to show Emma over the next week. It was all a bit short notice, but at the end we were able to put an acceptable program together. We planned the following workshops for the following week:<br>

`Monday`: On next Monday Emma come with us to the school, to get an insight of our study.<br>
`Tuesday`: For Tuesday Morning we planned a short presentation about our company and our services. In the afternoon I would like to show Emma something about the programming language Python.<br>
`Wednesday`: On Wednesday Yonea planned an introduction about HTML and CSS.<br>
`Thursday`: On Thursday Yonea and me are out of office because our 60% ratio. We asked our coworker Kiru and Jim to do some workshops with Emma. Kiru would like to show Emma something about Virtual-Machines and Jim does a workshop with the Rasperry Pi.<br>
`Friday`: On Friday Morning we planed a short review with Emma about the trial week. In the afternoon we have the possibility to join Rubén and Armstrong to view how they install some new nodes in the datacenter<br>


In this week i learned how to manage some short-term tasks. John explained us that this can be very normal in the IT. I think that Yonea and I did not a bad job.<br>
![Week](emma.jpg)
</p><br>
<p></p>

## 20/09/21 - 24/09/21
### @School
<p align="justify">
On Monday Yonea and me met us as discussed with Emma at 08:30 at the entrance of Welle 7. Then we visited together the subject WebG. I think it was a well opportunity for Emma to see how it's inside of our study.<br>

### @Work
For the rest of the week we have arranged with Emma that she can be in the office at 10:00 AM each day.<br>

On Tuesday morning we showed Emma our company in detail. Rafael Wicht did a short introduction of the areas of activity of our job. After that I started with my workshop. I demonstrated Emma the basics of the program language Python. I tried to bring in some programming tasks, where she can playfully learn, how to write programs with Python. Emma seemed very interested and asked questions diligently. As a last point I provided Emma some useful links, if she is interested in Python programming in the future. At the end oft the day I was quite happy about my short workshop.<br>

The next day, Yonea showed Emma how to design a website using HTML and CSS. While this I focussed me on the intern python module. I learned about state machines and algorithms. There are two different types of state machines and they can be determenistic and non-deterministic. Deterministic means that only one Statechange of a specific character can be performed, while by non-deterministic statemachines multiple statechanges with the same character are possible. I did serveral tasks about the topic, where i had to draw statemachines or to decide whether a statemachine is derterministic or non-deterministic.<br>

On Thursday I had my free day, which i used to prepare me for the next school session.<br>

The following day, Yonea and I did a review of the trial week together with Emma. In the afternoon we had the possibilty to see our companys datacenter together with Armstrong and Rubén. They assembled and installed four new nodes in the lab.<br>
For me it was very interesting, because I have never been able to see a datacenter from this close up. In case of questions or uncertainties, Rubén and Armstrong were very helpful and informed us in great detail.<br>

![Datacenter](datacenter.jpg "<b>Datacenter |</b> Credits: Yonea Koch")

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 28/09/21 - 30/09/21
This week I continued working on the Python module.<br>

I learned about conditions and loops. Now I'm able to write an "if: else:" statement. Furthermore I practiced how to use for-, foreach- and while loops correctly. It was fundamental to exercice on different tasks, to obtain a solid base of the theorie. Until now is stored all the previous files local on my notebook. If it's necessary, i have the possibilty to have a look to this files, when something recurring is not directly clear. I also recommend W3-Schools, if you have questions regarding programming languages.<br>

The next thing was to learn how to iterate trough a list or an array using a for loop. For this I used the different return possibilities "return" & "yield". Another important part of this week, was to understand how object oriented programming works in Python.<br>

On Thursday Yonea had her last day at our company. We became a very good PiBS-team in the meantime. I think it is a great pity that she has ended the journey with this, but that's life. I wish her the best for the future and I think that we will surely run into each other sometime.<br>

## 06/10/21 - 08/10/21
During this week I got the beatiful message, that I have the possibilty to move into a shared room here in Bern from middle of october. I'm very happy about this because commuting, in my opinion, can become quite uncomfortable after a while.<br>

At Work i continued with the Python module. The main topics of this week were OOP, errorhandling, PIP and casting. I learned that classes are blueprints, which define the attributes and functions of their objects. Therefore I did an interesting task, where I should create a dog and a cat class to represent a fight between the objects with specific functions. I had to realize that the OOP concept of Python is a bit different as from Java.<br>
After the OOP introduction I went to the topic errorhandling, which is also an important basic in Python. The goal is to detect errors early and act accordingly to avoid program errors in the subsequent code. Keywords are "`try:`, `except:` (& optional --> `else:`, `finally:`)". I'm now able to test out a code block with `try:` and then to decide what should happen if an error occurs or not.<br>
Furthermore, I learned how to download and import predefined packages using PIP in the command line interface. Then i got a short introdution, how to cast the different types of variables.<br>

On Friday afternoon, I gave a small presentation to Rafael about what I had learned that week.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 13/10/21 - 15/10/21
This week I reached the end of the first part of the Python module. The final task was to implement a TicTacToe console game using my previous basic knowledge.
It was quit interesting, to implement this first task. I tried to bring some color into the game to make it a bit clearer. For this I imported a predefined class from PIP, which is called "termcolor".
![TicTacToe Console Game](tictactoe.jpg "<b>Tic Tac Toe |</b> Screenshot")
Afterwards I did the voluntary task, where a GUI for the TicTacToe had to be implemented. I tried to realize it with the pygame-package. To learn how to use pygame, I watched a tutorial on youtube.
The final result was as follows:
![TicTacToe GUI](GUITTT.jpg "<b>Tic Tac Toe GUI |</b> Screenshot")
For me it was a very exciting week. I learned about, how to implement large code on my own. The tasks did not have many concrete specifications, which gave one a certain freedom during the realization.
</p><br>
<p></p>

## 20/10/21 - 22/10/21
During this week I continued with the second Python sub-module. The core topics in this sub-module were UML-standards: the Nassi-Schneiderman diagram, the Use-Case diagram and the classdiagram.<br>

First I got some basic information about UML. The main idea of UML is to approach a graphical schema to implement Software.
Then I got in touch with the Nassi-Schneidermann diagram. I learned about the different blocks, which are useful for the graphical representation of code decissions. For this I did a task where I had to describe my dating process.<br>

After that I earned the basic knowledge about the Use-Case diagram, which describes the interaction with a software system. There I saw the different graphical Elements and the corresponding table for the information flow.
Then I did a task, where I had visualize how a party night of me could look like.<br>

When we implement software it's useful to show up the different relations between the classes. For this a class diagram could be very practical. A classdiagram contains the variables and methods of a class. Furthermore, the various relationships and interactions between the classes are mapped.<br>

In the upcoming two weeks I have to possibility to programm a console-casino in Python.
</p><br>
<p></p>

## 27/10/21 - 29/10/21
On Wednesday I was sick in bed due to the effects of the 2nd vaccination.<br>

For my console-casino I had to draw a class-diagram with the relations between the different classes.<br>
When I finished that, I organised a call with John to view the diagram with each other.
At the end the class-diagram looked then as follows.

![Class-diagram](classdiagram.jpg "<b>Casino class-diagram |</b> Screenshot")

On Friday morning I repeated the OOP concept to prepare me on the casino task.
In the afternoon we had our 10th anniversary event. Until the end it was a very successful event.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 03/11/21 - 12/11/21
During this two weeks i implemented my console-casino.<br>

The first step was to create the basic structure of the code. For this I prepared all classes and methods, which I drawed in the class diagram before. Each casino game inherits the basic structure of the Game() class, which gives the possibility to add new games to the casino at any time with little effort. After that I started programming the roulette() class. The difficult part here, was to implement the game logic. The roulette rules were slightly slimmed down by me for my casino, which is why I called it Xaviers' Roulette. In the game you have now the possibilty to bet on a number between 0 and 36, on even numbers, on odd numbers, on red numbers and on black numbers.<br>

The task wasn't so easy as I expected first. In the beginning, I had a bit of trouble implementing the various relationships between classes. Sometimes I needed help, when I was at a loss. Therefore I could contact John, who gave me helpful advice. During these two weeks I could gain a lot of knowledge about OOP in Python. It was a very good exercise to deepen again based on the learned theory.<br>

After finishing the casino task, I prepared the final presentation on the Python module, which I will present to John and Rafael.
</p><br>
<p></p>

## 17/11/21 - 19/11/21
This week I started with a new module, in which I will learn how to administrate servers and networks with the Linux CLI.<br>
On Tuesday morning, I held the final presentation of the Python module to John and Rafael, where I showed various tasks and gave a reflection on the past module.
After that I started with the new module. Rafael provided me with the theory. The first step was to install the software VirtualBox on which later Linux will be instantiated as a virtual machine, because I'm working on the operating system windows. In addition, the Vagrant software is installed, which makes it easy to set up and manage virtual machines.<br>

After installing the necessary software, I set up the virtual machine using Rafael's instructions. He also showed me how to configure the optional Windows Terminal application from the Microsoft Store so that each time you open the application, you were directly in the correct directory where you can start the virtual machine. Another advantage of this application is that multiple terminal tabs can be used simultaneously.<br>

After opening the Windows terminal application, the virtual machine can be started using the following commands:
- `vagrant up`<br>
- `ssh default`<br>

After entering these commands you are in the Bash shell.

During the rest of the time I started with the Linux tutorial on the website of ryanstutorial, where I learn the basics in the Linux CLI.<br>
In the meantime, I continued to work on linear algebra on Friday.
</p><br>
<p></p>

## 24/11/21 - 26/11/21
On this wednesday I continued with the Linux tutorial on ryanstutorial.net till I completed all the 13 chapters.
The main goal of this tutorial was to learn how to interact with the bash shell. It's quit interesting to work on the CLI instead of using a GUI.
After that I wrote my first little script, which is useful for creating any backups of files.<br>

During the rest of the week I exercised on RHCSA 8 Cert Guide. Therfore I read different chapters and did some tasks on these topics.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 01/12/21 - 03/12/21
Now I have been 4 months @Amanox Solutions and this week I start my 5th month. I'm still happy that I can complete my trainee program in such a cool company!<br>

On wednesday till friday I continued with the RHCSA 8 Cert Guide.<br>
Here a list of the most important topics I have worked on till yet:
- `Basics and Environment`<br>
- `Users and Groups`<br>
- `Managing Software`<br>
- `Working with Systemd`<br>

In each chapter you have to complete differnet Excercices about the topic and a knowledge quiz at the end.
In chapter `Basics and Environment` I deepned my knowledge, which I have already acquired from the ryanstutorial.
Thereby it was again about the handling of the shell and the basic commands, which are used for the work with the file system hierarchy.
In chapter `Users and Groups` I learned how to grant access rights to different actors in the environment and how to manage Users and Groups.
The main goal of the chapter `Managing software` was to learn how to get software on your system and to keep it up to date.
Last but not least I worked on the `Working with Systemd` chapter, where I learned how to use systemd configuarations for different process flows on Linux.<br>

On Thursday I also had my end-of-the-year-meeting with Dan and John.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 08/12/21 - 10/12/21
This week I continued working on the RHCSA 8 Cert Guide.
To familiarize myself with the topic of network configuration on CentOS, I completed the basic course on networks that the coaches prepared for me. The course can be found on the blog page of Fabian Brunner.<br>

Thereby I acquired the basic knowledge in the following topics. <br>

Basic Concepts:
- `different network areas`<br>
- `Latency`<br>
- `Network reference models`<br>
- `Functionality of the different parts of the ISO/OSI layer model`<br>

Internet Protocol:
- `IPv4 and IPv6`<br>
- `network mask`<br>
- `Subnets`<br>

More:
- `DNS`<br>
- `Ports`<br>
- `Firewall`<br>
- `different network protocols`<br>

After that I started with the chapter Networks in the RHCSA 8 Cert Guide. The first step was to learn how to validate network configurations. This included, among other things, the temporary mutation of the IP address, routing and the link status of the packet transmission. In another step I practiced how to set up the hostname for communication and how to add a selected DNS server.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 26/01/22 - 28/01/22
After my two-week winter vacation and the subsequent semester exams, I am now back to the daily routine at Amanox Solutions. The new modules in the university of applied sciences start already next week. Due to the current situation, I work mostly from home and attend classes homebased as well. During this and the next weeks it is about completing and finishing the internal module [Networks.](https://fabianbrunner.netlify.app/docs/chapter2/)

For this, I have been repeating the provided theory again and have been doing some tasks to create subnets. Thereby I got a little theory input from Jim, which was very useful for the tasks. Over the next week, I will be provided with several more tasks from Jim, which will be completed using the Cisco Packet Tracer. This is a simulation and visualization tool for networks, which we will also use later in class at FFHS.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 02/02/22 - 04/02/22
This week I started with some LAB-tasks in the cisco packet tracer. I started with some Basic Tasks to get to know and understand the software better.

#### Task 1 - 7
Create a network with just a switch and 2 clients (laptop and PC). The clients should be able to ping eachother. Expand the network with a DHCP server. The clients should get an IP from your defined DHCP pool. Expand the network with a router and place the DHCP server in another subnet. The clients and the server should be in different subnets. Configure your devices correctly, and your clients should still be able to get an IP-Address from the DHCP server. Expand the network with a webserver, which you place in the same subnet the DHCP server resides (call it the internal server subnet). Can your clients access the website? Expand your serverfarm with a DNS server. Give all your servers a name and check, if your clients can ping them with just the name. Can you open the website with the name now? Expand your network with an access point (AP). Connect a new, additional laptop to the client subnet via the AP. Add an additional router, connect it to the switch in the internal servers subnet. Add a new switch and connect it to the new router. Add a printer and connect it to the new switch. Create a DNS record for the printer.

![Task 1](tracer2.png "<b>LAB Cisco Packet Tracer |</b> Screenshot")

After these instructive introductory tasks, I turned my attention to the big module task, which I have not yet completely finished. The goal was to build 4 subnets representing a company network.
- 1 Office network (with subnets IT, Office-Employees, Printer)
- Production network
- Internal server network
- DMZ network<br>

The different devices in the respective networks should receive an IP from the DHCP server in the internal server network. In addition, the 4 main networks should be interconnected by means of an ASA firewall and regulate the various traffic restrictions.

![Task 1](tracer3.png "<b>Big-LAB |</b> Screenshot")

It was a very exciting and educational week for me. I also had a lot of fun. For the most part, I had to work with the CLI to configure routers or firewalls. For this I informed myself mainly about the Cisco-manuals in the internet. The Cisco Packet Tracer is a very powerful tool, which simplifies the entrance in the area of the network technology playfully.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 09/02/22 - 11/02/22
During this week I continued on the Big-LAB excercice in the Network-Module. It was still about configuring the ASA firewall between the different networks. The goal here was to set the 4 interfaces according to various predefined rules for filtering the traffic.To limit the traffic I created four access lists (ACL's) and assigned them to the right interfaces.  At first I was a bit confused, but after some research I found my way around. I read up on the topic on the Cisco Man-Page. It was important to know the correct tcp and udp ports on layer 3.

Now I have agreed with Jim that we will look at the task together on occasion and he will give me feedback on it.

After finishing this rather small module I started on Friday with the next "Intro to the Cloud" module from Luca and Dom. You'll hear more about that next week. Now it's time for the weekend! ;-)

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 16/02/22 - 18/02/22
This week I continued with the “Intro to the Cloud” Module.

Luca and Dominik provided me with introductory material for this in the form of videos on a personal website. At the beginning, it was about the basics of virtualization and the associated function of the hypervisor. Afterwards, I got an overview of how containers work and what dominant market leaders exist in this field. In addition, the term “hyperconverged” was explained in a video. After that, a Nutanix video gave me an insight into the private cloud sector.
In a further step, I was introduced to the public cloud, where I learned about the various providers in detail.

After the introduction, I created a Microsoft Azure Educate account and instantiated a first virtual machine and accessed it using RPD.

Afterwards, Fabian told me how to access my AWS LAB. The first LAB task was to create an EC2 WordPress instance and to write a first post on the created website.

</p><br>
<p></p>

## 24/02/22 - 25/02/22

That Thursday, I continued experimenting on my AWS account. I tested several different VM's in my EC2. Fabian showed me how to access the different instances via the CLI using Putty. With this knowledge, I could now adjust and change various things, such as customizing the user data and the behaviour of the instance.

On Friday I received an assignment from Dan. This one is about monitoring our lab costs from all the staff involved. Lately, there were more and more unnecessary, high costs due to services that were not really used. To solve this problem, I should contact the users more and clarify whether the services are really used. In addition, the input was there to possibly automate this process, since the invoice information can be retrieved at any time as a CSV document.
Accordingly, I will think about it and look for a potential solution.

Today, Remo will have a farewell apero, which I will attend.

During these to weeks, I finished the "Intro to the Cloud" module by giving a presentation on the tasks I completed. Afterwards, I looked into AWS-billing topic (mentioned last week ↑) and discussed it with Dan.

Another goal of this week was to start with the new module "IAM&Account". As a result, I now know the difference between Authentication and Authorization. In addition, I have stored the MFA on the root account and created a user via IAM, with which I will work in the future on AWS, since one should use the root user only for billing, IAM, etc..

Furthermore, I can now create IAM groups, provide permissions and then link them to the users.
I also know how to change the sign-in link for the users and configure the desired password policy.
I find working with AWS very exciting. In the meantime, I am very well supported and you can see that a lot of heart and soul is put into the cloud modules. I would like to thank all the coaches involved for this.

In the interim, I have also received the grades for the first semester from the university of applied sciences. It is worth mentioning that I passed 5 out of 6 modules. At the end of April I have the chance to take a re-examination of the module I did not pass.

After completing the "IAM&Account" module, John slipped me another exercise on implementing a Quote app. I have to say that I was allowed to inform myself independently in order to understand what exactly I was deploying.
In the first of the four exercises, I implemented the basic architecture of the Quote app. For this I needed the following instances:

- EC2 dev-server
- EC2 backend-server
- S3 frontend-bucket
- DynamoDB

The first step was to create roles with the appropriate permissions for the two EC2 instances. I also added two security groups for the virtual machines. Then I launched the development server and the backend server.
In a further step, I created a DynamoDB, which I filled with various quotes. Afterwards I tested if the backend could access the database.
Then I set up an S3 bucket which hosts the static website. After that I uploaded the static web application (React) to the created bucket. I then launched the React app on the frontend and accessed the frontend's public IP.

During the realization I had some failures / challenges, because the guide was not so up to date. However, I was able to fix these bugs. Sometimes it took a bit more time than expected though.

The second part of the exercise (quote-app) was about implementing an elastic-architecture. For this, loadbalancing and autoscaling comes into play.
For this I made an image of the backend-server to create arbitrary new backends from the template via autoscaling. From the template I created a new backend-instance. Afterwards I prepared an application-loadbalancer with the corresponding target-group (the two backends). Afterwards I tested the loadbalancer and was forwarded alternately to the two different public IP's. Finally I created an autoscaling group. During the configuration I made sure that always at least 2 backend instances are running and that with a large load up to a maximum of 4 backends can run simultaneously. In addition, the configuration of the launch configuration from the prefabricated image.

In the third part of the exercise I implemented a serverless architecture. For this I created a lambda function with Python. Afterwards I added a new HTTP API.
The application now works serverless.
As an optional task I created a CICD pipeline to automate the backend programming, which can automatically create a lambda function and an Rset API. For this I created a code commit repo with the corresponding Python file for the lambda function and the "SAM.cf" file. After that I created the pipeline and referenced the new API in the S3 bucket.

In the last part of the task, I used the AWS Comprehend service to analyze the sentiments of the different quotes. To do this, I accessed the Comprehend service in the Lambda function, which now also provides the sentiment of the quotes.

I found the tasks very cool. Sometimes it was a bit challenging, but I think that's the only way to learn, because you have to deal with the matter in depth to implement the working solution.
