## What are my actual goals and what I try to do different from now on.

As I mentioned last week, I've been thinking about how I want to improvise my presentation style and the presentations themselves. Below you will find some thoughts on the problem areas.

### Prepare better

I need to thoroughly study and structure the slides. I will think in advance about what I want to say on each point. After preparing, I will rehearse the presentation, time it, and record it using a screen recording tool like Teams, including webcam view. Then, I will review the recording to focus on weaker areas and improve them in subsequent iterations.

### Read less from the presentation

During my last presentation, I had too much text on the slides, which made me read directly from them. To improve, I will use bullet points and work more with graphics or images. This ties into preparing better and aiming to speak more freely.

### Use media more effectively

I will plan which media to use and what I want to show with them beforehand. I need to clarify the core message and how to convey it to the audience, perhaps using a whiteboard. This preparation might include sketching out content beforehand to avoid drawing something nonsensical during the presentation.

### Reduce nervousness

In a sales enablement training, several useful strategies were suggested. I want to try focusing on my breathing and finding a steady rhythm. Another method is to tense various muscle groups right before presenting—pressing my legs down firmly while sitting or clenching my fists to tense my arm muscles. Tensing muscles releases adrenaline, which can help me feel more focused and energetic, better managing internal stress.

### Improve body language

I will concentrate on being aware of my body, avoiding wandering around unnecessarily. If possible, I will find a spot that allows a good view of the audience and proximity to the media like the whiteboard. I will also focus on avoiding nervous or unnecessary movements.

### Adopt storytelling

I have observed Sämi several times during his presentations and noticed that he often tries to convey a story rather than just presenting facts to the audience. I realize that integrating storytelling in presentations, especially those with technical subjects, might be challenging. However, I plan to experiment with this technique in future presentations to see if it enhances audience engagement and comprehension.

## What did I do?

Diese Woche habe ich mit dem IaaS Modul von John angefangen. Das Modul ist sehr Tasklastig im Gegensatz zu anderen Autoren, was ich für den Kontext Hands-on sehr gut finde, jedoch gewisse Zeit in Anspruch nimmt. Gleichermassen gilt zu erwähnen, dass das vordere Modul "IaC & DevOps" sehr sehr wertvoll ist, da die Tasks in diesem Modul alle in Terraform implementiert werden müssen. Dadurch habe ich eine gute Basis und komme gut voran.

Die bereits erledigten Tasks könnt ihr bei Bedarf im meinem Repo auf Github einsehen. Ich habe @PiBS - Alle auf das Repo berechtigt.
