## 29/01/2024 - 02/02/2024
After a tough exam period, I finally had a week's vacation. I went to Valais to visit the family, especially my grandmother in the old people's home. I also went snowboarding and slacklining again. In between, I had a beer with colleagues who I haven't seen much all year because they are studying elsewhere. I also spent some time with my girlfriend ;-)

On February 05/02 I started the new semester and thus the module Cryptology. Although the topic is interesting, I had to realize that I am no longer completely familiar with the modular arithmetic that was taught in the first semester as part of the Discrete Mathematics module. I will therefore have to do some extra work in the near future.

@Amanox I devoted myself to various open points, including my annual planning (division of work/school days). There were also some internal IT tasks to deal with.

After that, I continued working on the IaC & DevOps module. I had completed the W1 slidedeck before the vacations. As both Slidedeck W1 & W2 are very comprehensive and do not contain any direct tasks, I decided to create a publication. There I summarized the essentials in order to better internalize what I had learned. This way, I can refer back to the knowledge via the blog page if necessary and make it easier for me to create the presentation slides towards the end of the module.

Looking back, I was able to expand and deepen my knowledge this week. I have set myself the goal of completing Slidedeck W2 & W3 next week, continuing with the content on Github, i.e. continuing with the videos and working on the practical hands-on tasks.
