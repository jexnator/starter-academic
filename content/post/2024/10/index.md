## What are my actual goals?

This week I am focusing on completing the planning phase of my transfer report (over 2 semesters). The goal is to complete the final planning and get approval from the university and supervisors. I am also continuing to work on the goals I mentioned last week regarding my internal apprenticeship.

## What did I do?

Just like last week, I spent most of the week working on the IaaS module. On Thursday morning, I invested some additional time in preparing for the scheduling meeting, which took place in the afternoon. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my supervisors once again for their time and valuable feedback.

Unfortunately, it was mentioned at this week's service delivery meeting that four very important key players will be leaving us, which is of course a great pity for Amanox, but understandable given their personal plans. Three of these people were and are a great support to me in my apprenticeship to date and I was able to learn a lot from them along the way. Thank you for that and all the best for your plans. <3

## How did I improve?

Looking back on this week, I tried to improve myself, for example by taking more time to prepare for the scheduling interview and going through a PPTX presentation during this interview to keep the common thread and work through all the points together with my mentors.
