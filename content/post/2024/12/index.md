## What are my actual goals?

- Continue with current module completion pace
- Start with "NoSQL & Distributed Systems" module
- Enjoying my upcoming vacation

## What did I do?

This week I started with the first slide deck of the NoSQL module. I'm confident that I'll get through it within the set time frame.

| NoSQL & Disributed Systems Publication | [NoSQL Publication]({{< relref "/publication/NoSQL" >}})                  |

In the area of internal IT, I got the accounts and accesses ready for our new Head of Operations this week. There was also an SSL certificate for Potal-Login to renew and various other tasks. In addition, there were a few nodes to haul around and I then made the assignments for the respective locations for Omero and Nicu, who were still in Barca at that time.

Sepp dropped by on Thursday for a Fifa and spent the rest of the day with us on site.

## How did I improve

I was able to refresh my knowledge of distributed systems this week. Particularly worth mentioning here were the CAP and PACELC theorems, which we had already looked at in one of the first semesters at school, but at that time I couldn't imagine much about them due to a lack of basic knowledge, which is different now.

You will hear from me again in 3 weeks. I'm spending the next two weeks on the island of Elba.
Cheers and keep your chin up! ;-)
