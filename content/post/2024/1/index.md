The first 3 weeks of the new year were busy again. In addition to the regular work in internal IT and the internal modules, I was also busy preparing for my semester exams.

In internal IT, I was allowed to create a test AWS account for Redbull North America for Matthieu and Raphael. I also deleted various old Lab accounts and created a new account for the new employee. I furthermore completed some administrative tasks, such as deleting old M365, Keeper and Github accounts, creating device inventory in ITSM, opening Hubspot accounts and Keeper accesses for new employees + preparing the access for the back office deputy.

I was able to make progress in the area of internal modules. Firstly, I was able to work through the first block of the IaC and DevOps module. Dino's slides were very well structured and gave me a good introduction to the topic. The core topics were devops and automation. I found the introduction to the various IaC tools exciting. Previously, I only knew CloudFormation, CDK and Terraform, which according to the module belong to the category of server provisioning tools. I was not aware that "ad hoc scripts" (for example in Bash), configuration management tools (such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible or Saltstack), server templating tools (such as Docker, Vagrant or Packer) also belong to the IaC area.

Fäbs also created a spontaneous module in which Gian and I were allowed to assemble a PC for his brother. Fäbs ordered the components from Digitec and then informed us when we could get started. Gian was already familiar with the subject and so was I to some extent, as I was once allowed to assemble and stack 13 business workstations for the casino in Crans Montana on my own during a “taster” (Schnuppern) session at Insysta (an IT company in Valais). As a result, we PiBS students made good progress and complemented each other really well. In between, of course, with a few passionate theoretical inputs from Dan.

In retrospect, we managed the assembly without any major problems and can be summarized as follows:

1. preparing the case and installing the mainboard (ROG Strix B650E-F)
2. placing the CPU (AMD 7 series), attaching it and installing the water cooling (Corsair WAK H150i) on top.
3. insert the RAM (4x 16GB Trident Z5 DDR5) and the SSD (Samsung 2TB M.2 NVME).
4. installation of the GPU (ASUS Radeon TUF GAMING RX 7900)
5. installation of the 6 fans (Be quiet!)
6. pull the cables and wire them up nicely
7. connect the PSP (be quiet!)
8. staging with Windows Home (by detour, i.e. installation of the LAN & WLAN drivers via CMD, in order to continue with network selection, as network is now mandatory for staging with Windows 11)

All in all, it was a very cool experience to be able to assemble a high-end gaming PC. Thanks to Fäbs for the trust!

Looking back, the first 3 weeks of the new year were very instructive. I was able to improve my skills in various areas and I'm happy with that.
