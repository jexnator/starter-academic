## What are my actual goals?

My main focus remains on completing the internal modules at Amanox and preparing for my school exams. Additionally, I aim to finalize our school project.

## What did I do?

The first two weeks of this period, I spent on vacation with my girlfriend on the island of Elba. It was an ideal time since it was not yet high season, and the island was not overcrowded. We rented a 100ccm scooter and explored the island (btw in Italy, you only need a car license for up to 125ccm). During the vacation, I dedicated 2-3 hours every two days to work on our school project (Multiplayer Online Poker) and completed my part, which was the frontend. Our group divided the tasks as follows: I handled the frontend, Fynn took care of the backend, and Lorenzo was responsible for the integration. On Mondays and Fridays during the holiday, I attended school remotely.

After the vacation, I continued working on the NoSQL module at Amanox and completed several internal IT tasks.

However, a problem arose with our school project. Despite Lorenzo having 2.5 weeks to complete the integration after the frontend and backend were finished, he encountered issues. During this time, Fynn and I asked Lorenzo several times whether everything was going smoothly with the integration, which he always confirmed a little later. Four days before the deadline, Lorenzo informed us that he was having trouble getting the JS code to work. Fynn and I decided then to spend the weekend fixing it to present a working product on Monday. Unfortunately, we realized halfway through that the integration code was poorly written, and it was best to start fresh in a new branch. Despite working late into the night on Saturday and Sunday, we couldn't finish in time for the presentation. As a result, we could only show the individual components, which was disappointing. Lorenzo had minimal participation and contribution to the group, which we reported to our docent. The lecturer was not satisfied and told us that he should have given us an unsatisfactory grade. Nevertheless, he gave us the chance of a two-week extension to deliver a fully functional product, with Lorenzo taking the lead and making his missing contribution to the project. However, the docent was very happy that Fynn and I informed him about this discrepancy in the project.

## How did I improve?

Currently, I haven't seen any improvements. The ongoing stress and excessive screen time are affecting my productivity and overall well-being. The delay in the school project, combined with the additional workload of covering for Lorenzo and preparing for module exams, has put me behind schedule. On the other hand, I would also like to make progress with the internal modules, i.e. hold the dated presentations. I am looking forward to the break from classes, even though it is only a month compared to the two months at other universities of applied sciences. - Sorry that I can't report anything positive here in this chapter.

## What will I do different from now?

Regarding the school project, Fynn and I were too kind and naive in working with Lorenzo. Originally, it was just Fynn and me planning to implement a Blackjack game. Lorenzo, who hadn't found a group by the second PVA (Pr√§senzveranstaltung), asked to join us. We agreed out of kindness, but this decision led us to take on a more complex project, Texas Hold'em Poker. I should have anticipated issues based on previous group work experiences with Lorenzo, where he exhibited the same lack of contribution. This time, we informed the professor about the poor collaboration. Moving forward, I need to be more discerning and assertive, saying "no" when necessary and making decisions based on actions and facts, not out of sympathy and goodwill.
