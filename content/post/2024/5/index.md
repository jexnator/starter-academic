## What are my actual goals?
Refining my goals from last week is still a priority. My focus is on improving efficiency in structuring and completing technical tasks and on my time management.

## What did I do this week?
I successfully patched the Bitnami LAMP stack on AWS Lightsail for the Amanox website and migrated WordPress. There was one setback when updating WordPress. Despite several approaches - updating via the GUI, manually updating via SFTP by swapping core folders and attempting to update on the VM via the WP-CLI in a gradual version jump - the update failed. This experience was frustrating and showed me that despite market leadership, software can sometimes be crap. Now I have agreed with our creative strategist Oliver Blaum that he will update Wordpress via a special staging plugin, where he has a license. My involvement in these tasks limited the time available to work on the internal module, which was an unintended and annoying consequence of the WP-Jazz.

## How did I improve this week?
In a Teams call with Dino about a school project, I was able to share with him my progress and the challenges I was facing both internally and in school. This interaction was very valuable for me.

## What will I do different from now?
Reflecting on the past week has shown me that I can improve my approach to tasks. I sometimes tend to spend too much time on details and I lose power over prioritizing tasks because I care about completing tasks successfully. While this attention to detail is sometimes beneficial, it can also lead to inefficiency. In the future, I want to improve my decision-making process in terms of prioritizing tasks and knowing when to delegate, inform or get help.
