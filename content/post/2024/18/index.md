## What are my actual goals?

- Pass the retest in cryptology.
- Prepare and initiate Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) setup for a client.
- Work remotely during the workation in Croatia.
- Conduct an Active Directory (AD) workshop with Mergim.
- Finalize my seminar and transfer projects.

## What did I do?

The period began with the preparation for the cryptology retest, focusing on core concepts and getting comfortable again with the mathematical aspects (including modular arithmetic, extended Euclidean algorithm, square and multiply, RSA formulas, and ECC formulas). This effort paid off as I successfully passed the exam.

@Amanox Mergim and I initiated the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) project setup for a client. During the initial meeting, we reviewed the specific use case in detail with the client. We then scheduled additional meetings and planned an IaC workshop, which Mergim and I will conduct. Finally, we provided the client with instructions on how to prepare their IT workstations, including downloading, installing, and setting up Terraform.

During the workation in Croatia (05/10 - 11/10), Mergim conducted an in-depth Active Directory (AD) workshop for Gian and me. Mergim, who has extensive experience in AD, led us through various technical aspects of AD, starting with an overview of its role as a centralized authentication system within a corporate network. We covered the setup and configuration of domain controllers, including domain joining. Additionally, we discussed the structure of Organizational Units (OUs) for managing different objects within the directory, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for centralized management of user and computer settings. Mergim also demonstrated us best practices and how to troubleshoot common issues in AD environments. We also set up a hybrid identity environment by connecting the local AD to Azure AD, covering practical aspects like password hash synchronization and Azure AD Connect configuration.

On the academic front, I finalized my transfer paper. Mergim, Fabian, and I held a mid-project meeting to review the current progress. After incorporating their feedback, I completed the paper. The engineered automation tool can now be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/jexnator/wordpress-bitnami-lightsail-patch-migrate-update).

Simultaneously, I also made significant progress on my FFHS seminar paper, which compares four IaC tools (Terraform, Pulumi, SaltStack, and Ansible) for cloud infrastructure provisioning on AWS. I have outlined the paper's initial structure and shortly I will focusing on practical implementations.

Additionally, I achieved the Terraform Associate certification, improving my skills in cloud infrastructure automation.

From October 14th to 18th, 2024, I took a scheduled in Wallis, traveling in a camper with my girlfried. This break allowed me to recharge my batteries and return refreshed to my professional responsibilities. ;-)

#### How did I improve and what will I do differently from now?

Passing the cryptography retest and Terraform Associate certification confirmed that focused preparation pays off. I’ll keep this approach up for future exams and certifications.

As a company, we spent an enjoyable and productive week in Croatia on a workation. It was a valuable experience that not only allowed us to work in a different environment effectively, but also strengthened our team spirit. The mix of work and shared activities contributed to a positive dynamic within the team and it was great to see how well we adapted to this setup. Overall, it was a refreshing change that brought both personal and professional benefits and strengthened our ability to work together and stay connected.

The AD workshop helped me to deepen my understanding of identity and access management, both on-premises and in the cloud. These skills will help me with future projects involving hybrid identity setups.
