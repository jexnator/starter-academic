## What are my actual goals?
One of the main goals was to terminate the stuff of the IaC & Devops module and update our Wordpress website together with our Wordpress Guru aka Oli. This includes updating the underlying LAMP stack hosted on a Bitnami Lightsail VM as well as the Wordpress core version itself. Another personal goal of mine was to spend a great time with my colleagues at the Amanox Ski Weekend and enjoy the days in the alpine nature. At the same time, I was able to switch off a bit from the already stressful start to the semester @FFHS.

## What did I do?
Just like last week, I had to migrate the website to an updated Bitnami LAMP stack again. Unfortunately, our creative strategist preferred to prioritize the content changes for the new landing page and make them on the old instance instead of doing it on the new instance after the update. The second migration went quite quickly, however, as I still had the steps in my head and knew how to integrate the external MySQL DB and how to configure it in detail.

The Amanox Ski Weekend took place from Friday to Saturday. I was really looking very much forward to it in advance. Apart from the closed slopes on Saturday, the ski weekend was a complete success, whether it was skiing, running, Br√§ndydoging, in the club or eating together. I am firmly convinced that an event like this strengthens the team spirit within the company. I am very grateful that we are able to experience such an event once a year, which is by no means a matter of course and is also perceived as such by outsiders, my colleagues and my family. A big thank you goes to Sonja and Rebecca for organizing the event and also to the members of the Management who support and make the ski weekend possible.

I invested the rest of the time before the ski weekend and the week after in the internal IaC & Devops module. I will be giving the presentation there soon. Readers can find a summary of the content of the module in the publication.

## How did I improve?
As I mentioned last week, I've been working and am still working on partially shedding my obsession with details that sometimes time suffers from. I found myself a few times doing things that everyone else would consider already done or "not my level problem" but that I wanted to improve or work out. In those moments, I asked myself the simple YES/NO question: "Is it worth investing more time here in this particular case? If I couldn't answer the question with a 100% "yes", I immediately stopped the activity, which I consider a success. I will continue to pursue the issue over the next few weeks and keep track of the results.

## What will I do different from now?
Regarding the WordPress update, I don't think I communicated precisely enough with our Creative Strategist, which required a bit of a wake-up call from Dan. In the future, I will try to communicate more precisely. This means conveying a clear message about the assignment via a "call to action" and scheduling the tasks accordingly with a deadline (not just "as soon as possible").
