## What are my actual goals?
I've been thinking about the best way to structure my day. The idea is to set work packages and a time frame each morning and possibly even set alarms (e.g. on my smartphone) when time is over (as reminders). Another goal is to get up earlier to have more of the morning mental freshness and also make the most of my day, i.e. find a balance between work/school and free time.

## What did I do this week?
I worked with John-Nathan to fix an SMTP issue for our website and got some valuable tips from Sepp. We managed to use the official Vinci SMTP and implement noreply.amanox@axians.com as a service account, so that newsletters and marketing mailings work as usual again and don't come generically from the parent company's email address.

Together with Fäbl, I was also able to solve our website's DNS issue that had been occurring since our domain was transferred to the parent company. By working through the problem and getting input from Fäbl, I was able to refresh my DNS knowledge, which is a positive side effect for me.

Another task was to set up an AWS test account for a customer project + an OpenAI account, as the GPT4 API is needed in the application.

In the internal IaC and DevOps module, I was able to finish the second slide deck.

## How did I improve this week?
Looking back at the goals I set myself last week, I was able to improve in the area of planning. I try to consistently add new tasks I receive to Microsoft ToDo, schedule and prioritize them and remind myself. I have also added recursive weekly tasks for AWS cost management, writing this blog and Tempus. 

## What will I do different from now?
Reflecting on this week's improvements and goals, I realize how important it is to structure your daily routine, as I think there is a lot of context switching in IT. In the future, I want to allocate specific blocks of time for intensive work and minimize distractions to become more efficient. This approach will help me achieve my technical goals and ensure that I have enough time in the evenings for school, personal development and leisure.
