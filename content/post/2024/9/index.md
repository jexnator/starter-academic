## What are my actual goals?

The completion of the internal modules is now definitely the focus of my interest. My current goal is to complete the theoretical material of the IaaS module this week and next week and then start preparing (including focusing on the improvement goals, see last week) the final presentation. In addition, the disposition meeting for the TA is scheduled for next week. In preparation for this, I will give some more thought to the concept and structure of the TA and also inform myself about the chosen topic and methodology (DSRM).

## What did I do?

This week I worked almost exclusively on the IaaS module and dealt with the module tasks, which I continuously build up using Terraform, test and store in my [GitHub](https://github.com/JEX-98/aws/tree/main/Iaas) repository after completion. Since the theory of the module covers a lot of principles and components within EC2 and VPC, I am creating a summary of the most important aspects in the [IaaS publication]({{< relref "/publication/IaaS" >}}) in parallel to studying the slides, which will also help me to create the presentation at the end of the module.

## How did I improve?

Looking back, I can say that in the last few weeks I have been able to make better use of the three working days in terms of my time management, especially in terms of prioritizing the modules. I have now arranged it so that I take half an hour to an hour every working day in the morning for general to-dos (e.g. writing a blog, pending internal IT tasks, AWS cost check, TA, etc.) and use the rest of the time for internal training (certainly until all public modules have been completed). This stricter structuring helps me make better progress, which is a small success for me, and allows me to focus on the essentials, which reduces the need to change context too often.

## What will I do different from now?

As you will have noticed, my presence in the office has decreased somewhat in recent weeks. I currently spend at least one day a week in the HO. I don't do this because I don't like being in the office, but because it creates a focus window with fewer distractions where I can work better and more efficiently. In my opinion, this has worked well for my current priorities and that's why I want to keep it that way for the time being.
