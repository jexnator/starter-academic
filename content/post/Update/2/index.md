This week I had my second school day @FFHS, where I started the modules "computer networks", "data structures and algorithms" and "scientific work in relation to the transfer work". My first impression of the different and new lecturers was pretty good. Let's see what the future will bring with it in terms of the quality of the provided lessons.

During my free day (on tuesday) I prepared me for the next schoolday, where I complete the modules "Operate in a social and economic order" and "Software Engineering Modelling"

On wednesday I launched my week @Amanox. At 09:00 AM I had a training with Andreas, where he presented to Caro, Sonja and me the product range that we offer in our company. This was mainly about the different private cloud products and how the architectures behind them work. This training was very informative and valuable for me.

Afterwards, I helped Nino set up a new AWS account and configured it accordingly so that Anda and Filip can access the account via SSO.
The account is needed for show purposes at an upcoming event.

During the rest of the time, I dealt with the transfer of the BI tool. On Thursday afternoon, I worked on the presentation about the PiBS program, which I was allowed to present at the overall team meeting on Friday. During the presentation I showed the team what I had seen so far and I shared my experiences.

Afterwards, the monthly Amanox lunch took place, where Kiru first gave an interesting presentation about shoes and then we all ate together.

So I can look back on an interesting week and of course I am looking forward to what will be waiting for me in the coming weeks.
