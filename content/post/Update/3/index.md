This week I finished the code for the BI-Tool in the CDK. Unfortunately, my code does not compile correctly yet, which is why it cannot create the CloudFormation stack yet. Therefore I will still work on debugging it.

Furthermore, this week I helped Gianluca with some questions.

In addition, the Public Cloud Team's annual workshop took place on Friday, which I attended for the first time. In the first part you were allowed to report and give your own opinion about what is going well and what is going badly from the team's point of view. Since I haven't really worked on many projects within the team yet, I didn't really report on the topic. However, it was very valuable for me to hear from the other team members about their experience.
In a second part a SWOT analysis was done to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threads within the team. Each team member was allowed to write down their thoughts on post-it notes and put them on the whiteboard. Afterwards, we discussed the results with each other.

At the end of the day, I had a beer with some other employees before I drove back to Wallis.
