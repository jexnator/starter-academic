This week I finished the code for the BI-Tool in the CDK. Unfortunately, my code does not compile correctly yet, which is why it cannot create the CloudFormation stack yet. Therefore, I will be troubleshooting in the coming week.

Besides work, I helped Gianluca with some ambiguities.

Furthermore the Public Cloud Team's annual workshop took place on Friday, which I attended for the first time. In the first part each team member was allowed to report and bring in own opinions about what is going well and what is going badly from the team's point of view. Since I haven't really worked on many projects within the team yet, I didn't really report on the topic. However, it was very valuable for me to hear from the other team members about their experience.

In a second part a SWOT analysis was done to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats within the team. Each team member was allowed to write down their thoughts on post-it notes and put them on the whiteboard. Afterwards, we discussed the results.

At the end of the day, I had a beer with some other employees before I moved back to my hometown.
