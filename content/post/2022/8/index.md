During the last two weeks I finished the Serverless module with the final presentation. Since I was busy with the BI tool for a few weeks in between, I had to work up the material a bit to be able to present the completed tasks in detail. I also filled out the module evaluation.

In the following week I visited the introduction day of the civil service. Unfortunately I had to realize that this procedure will rather hinder me during my studies instead of having a positive effect.

On Thursday morning I created an overview of the FFHS modules using a kanban board. Thereby we students can assign the current modules to us, so that our PiBS coaches are always up to date.

A fellow student and I were given the opportunity to present the PiBS program at the Kollegium Brig during Friday. The rest of the time I invested in the preparation of this workshop together with my colleague.
