During the last few weeks I have neglected the blog a bit. Now I have to make up for this.
The BI tool is now running on the prod account and is functional and the associated CDK github repository has been created. In addition to the tool, a manually configured EC2 instance was set up for the Power BI gateway, since Microsoft does not allow direct access to AWS instances (in our case, the database). After redundant and successful test time, running both DB instances in Rafael's account and the Prod account, the no longer needed Lab account could be nuked.

I also helped Armstrong to change his password for his AWS root account.

In the meantime I spent another day with the implementation of sorting algorithms for the subject Data Structures and Algorithms. Since my group member relieved me a bit during the re-examination time, I did the full assignment for this, which in retrospect was quite time-consuming. However, the effort was worth it and the assignment received a grade of 6.0.

Last week on Thursday Andreas showed me the user interfaces of Nutanix, Cloudian and Rubrik and their corresponding functionalities.

On Friday, those present in the office were able to attend Matthieu's presentation on Bayesian probability theory, where he also showed how to break down the mathematical facts to real situations. Afterwards, everyone had a meal of Mongolian specialties.
