During this week I worked again on the BI-Tool. The final polish on the code was still missing, so it now compiles cleanly and spits out a CloudFormation template.
Since the CDK Python reference is not documented that extensively, I contacted Leo a few times regarding various questions.
To define various properties of instances, Typescript works with interfaces. The properties can be specified after the constructor of the class. In Python, the properties are defined directly in the respective class and are passed individually in the constructor. This still required a restructuring of the code from my side to get the same logic. However, I was able to learn things from it and refresh my Python knowledge at the same time.

On Thursday, Omero showed Gianluca and me the sales process in a small meeting. It was very informative and individual questions from our side were well answered by Omero.
On Friday, I briefly checked on the progress of the AWS Lab costs so far. The rest of the time I use to prepare for the upcoming post exams at the end of September.
