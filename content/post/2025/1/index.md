## What are my actual goals?

The new spring semester at FFHS is underway. I’m aiming for a good start in the modules (IT-Sec Management and Mobile Communication). Also, the Bachelor’s thesis is on the horizon, so I want to be well-prepared. Another goal is to get back to a more regular blog cadence (been slacking lately, sorry). Finally, I need to complete the domain transfer back to our preferred provider and finish swapping the SSD in Caro’s notebook.

## What did I do?

Last week, I met with Torsten to discuss my future at Amanox after finishing my PiBS studies. I’m currently in the Public Cloud team, but I expressed my wish to join Operations. I really enjoyed my time in the Public Cloud modules – especially the cool IaC and DevOps approaches. However, I'm more efficient with declarative tools like Terraform than with imperative programming, which can slow me down sometimes. At the same time, the Private Cloud side also fascinates me, particularly the Operations team. I noticed I like supporting others, so I can use that strength and gain my first full professional experience in IT. We agreed that once I’m done with the remaining PiBS modules and my thesis, I’ll join the Operations team.

Classes at FFHS started, so I now have to juggle studying for IT-Sec Management and Mobile Communication, plus planning the upcoming Bachelor’s thesis. I’ll probably share more details about the thesis here soon.

On the internal IT side, I’ve been preparing for the amanox.ch domain transfer back to Hoststar. The plan is to manage it ourselves again in AWS Route 53, because our mother company’s hosting blocks some of the DNS records we need. Of course, this also affects emails—we’ll lose their Exchange environment since they only keep domains in Exchange that they manage themselves. To compensate, we’ll use Hoststar’s mail service with forwarders from amanox.ch to axians.com. I’ve set up Route 53 DNS entries and gathered all the forwarder addresses so we can sort everything out over the weekend.

Another task this week was Caro’s broken Lenovo X1. We opened a support case, but while we wait for the onsite repair, I swapped her SSD into a spare X1 Yoga. Had to update a bunch of drivers, but eventually it worked.

Lastly, I realized I really want to make these blog posts a weekly thing again. I know I’ve been missing for a while. Let’s see if I can stick to it.

## How did I improve and what will I do differently from now?

I see that proper planning and consistency are crucial—both for my studies and @work. I want to maintain a regular routine of writing this blog every week, no excuses.

That’s it for now, you’ll hear from me next week!
