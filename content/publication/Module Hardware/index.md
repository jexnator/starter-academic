  1. <b> In the following part i would like to present you the different components, which are inside of a PC, server or a notebook.</b>
{{% /callout %}}

<b>Computer case:</b> Inside of the computer case you will find all following components of a Computer. The main idea is to protect the interior. It also contributes to a visual aspect of the computer.

![Computer Case](computer-case.jpg "<b>Computer case</b> (Unsplash: Onur Binay)")

<b>CPU (central processing unit):</b> The CPU is the brain of the computer. It does the logical calculations, processes data and passes informations to the other parts.

![CPU](processor.jpg "<b>CPU</b> (Unsplash: Fidel Fernando)")

<b>Motherboard:</b> The motherboard or also known as mainboard connects all parts to each other and enables communication between each other components.

![Motherboard](motherboard.jpg "<b>motherboard</b> (Unsplash: Thomas Jensen)")

<b>RAM (random access memory):</b> It's a temporary storage space to process data fast. The RAM is located nearby the CPU, to keep the latency as low as possible.

![RAM](ram.jpg "<b>RAM</b> (Unsplash: Luan Gjokaj)")

<b>Storage device:</b> A distinction is made between the HDD (hard disk drives) and the SSD (solid state drives). The HDD is working mechanical like a music turntable, while the SSD is a flash storage device. Both of them store data persistently.

![HDD](hdd.jpg "<b>HDD</b> (Unsplash: Art Wall - Kittenprint)")

<b>PSU (power supply unit):</b> The electricity from the power socket goes truth the PSU and is distributed to the various components.

![PSU](psu.jpg "<b>PSU</b> (Unsplash: Luke Hodde)")

<b>GPU (graphics processing unit):</b> It's a specialized chip to calcultate all graphic outputs fast. A CPU can theoretically do the same, but it takes much longer than the GPU.

![GPU](gpu.jpg "<b>GPU</b> (Unsplash: Nana Dua)")

<b>Cooling unit:</b> All components that consume electricity, are generating heat. Because of this reason, you need a cooling unit to prevent damages on the different modules.

## {{< hl >}}Johny Simulator{{< /hl >}}<br>

> The Johny Simulator shows us, how a RAM calculation is working. Additions and subtractions can be performed directly, while multiplications have to be added up over several steps. In the simulator you have the opportunity to write and simulate programms.<br> Here is a list of the program commands:<br>
‚óè `TAKE` The value of the location (given by the absolute address) is transported to
the accumulator.<br>
‚óè `SAVE` The value of the accumulator is transported to the location given by the absolute
address.<br>
‚óè `ADD` The value of a location (given by the absolute address) is added to the value
in the accumulator.<br>
‚óè `SUB` The value of a location (given by the absolute address) is subtracted from the
value in the accumulator.<br>
‚óè `INC` The value of the location (given by the absolute address) is incremented.<br>
‚óè `DEC` The value of the location (given by the absolute address) is decremented.<br>
‚óè `NULL` The value of the location (given by the absolute address) is set to zero.<br>
‚óè `TST` If and only if the location (given by the absolute address) has a zero value,
the next macro instruction is skipped.<br>
‚óè `JMP` The program is continued at the given location.<br>
‚óè `HLT` The simulator shows a message that the program is finished.<br>
<p></p>

Example programm for a multiplication <b>8 * 5 = 40</b><br>

| Adress | Data | Data type |
|--------|------|-----------|
| 020    | 8    | Factor    |
