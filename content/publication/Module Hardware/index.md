{{% callout note %}}
 In the following part i would like to present you the different components, which are inside of a PC, server or a notebook.
{{% /callout %}}

<b>Computer case:</b> Inside of the computer case you will find all following components of a Computer. The main idea is to protect the interior. It also contributes to a visual aspect of the computer.

<b>CPU (central processing unit):</b> The CPU is the brain of the computer. It does the logical calculations, processes data and passes informations to the other parts.

![CPU](processor.jpg "<b>CPU</b> (Unsplash: Fidel Fernando)")

<b>Motherboard:</b> The motherboard or also known as mainboard connects all parts to each other and enables communication between each other components.

![Motherboard](motherboard.jpg "<b>motherboard</b> (Unsplash: Thomas Jensen)")

<b>RAM (random access memory):</b> It's a temporary storage space to process data fast. The RAM is located nearby the CPU, to keep the latency as low as possible.

<b>Storage device:</b> A distinction is made between the HDD (hard disk drives) and the SSD (solid state drives). The HDD is working mechanical like a music turntable, while the SSD is a flash storage device. Both of them store data persistently.

<b>PSU (power supply unit):</b> The electricity from the power socket goes truth the PSU and is distributed to the various components.

![PSU](psu.jpg "<b>PSU</b> (Unsplash: Luke Hodde)")

<b>GPU (graphics processing unit):</b> It's a specialized chip to calcultate all graphic outputs fast. A CPU can theoretically do the same, but it takes much longer than the GPU.

<b>Cooling unit:</b> All components that consume electricity, are generating heat. Because of this reason, you need a cooling unit to prevent damages on the different modules.

<b>Advanced questions:</b>

{{< hl >}}How fast (in GHz) is the CPU you are using right now?{{< /hl >}}<br>
➡️Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz - 2.30 GHz
<p></p>
{{< hl >}}What chipset is on the motherboard? Could there be more options?{{< /hl >}}<br>
➡️64-bit operating system, x64-based processor<br>
➡️ x32 / x64 / x86
<p></p>
{{< hl >}}How many gigabytes of RAM are in the PC you’re using?{{< /hl >}}<br>
➡️16.0 GB (15.8 GB usable)
<p></p>
{{< hl >}}What is/are the storage medium/media in your PC?{{< /hl >}}<br>
➡️500GB SSD
<p></p>
{{< hl >}}Where is the PSU in your PC? What about a laptop?{{< /hl >}}<br>
➡️Inside the PC<br>
➡️External Adapter
<p></p>
{{< hl >}}Do you have a GPU?{{< /hl >}}<br>
➡️IGPU in the CPU; Intel HD Graphics 620 (GT2)
<p></p>
{{< hl >}}How does the cooling work in your device? What about a smartphone?{{< /hl >}}<br>
➡️My notebook is cooled from below by two fans<br>
➡️Smartphones in general; Heatpipe, which transmits the heat to the outside
