 "In the following part i would like to present you the different components, which are inside of a PC, server or a notebook.

<b>Computer case: Inside of the computer case you will find all following components of a Computer. The main idea is to protect the interior. It also contributes to a visual aspect of the computer.

<b>CPU (central processing unit):</b> The CPU is the brain of the computer. It does the logical calculations, processes data and passes informations to the other parts.

<b>Motherboard:</b> The motherboard or also known as mainboard connects all parts to each other and enables communication between each other components.

<b>RAM (random access memory):</b> It's a temporary storage space to process data fast. The RAM is located nearby the CPU, to keep the latency as low as possible.

<b>Storage device:</b> A distinction is made between the HDD (hard disk drives) and the SSD (solid state drives). The HDD is working mechanical like a music turntable, while the SSD is a flash storage device. Both of them store data persistently.

<b>PSU (power supply unit):</b> The electricity from the power socket goes truth the PSU and is distributed to the various components.

<b>GPU (graphics processing unit):</b> It's a specialized chip to calcultate all graphic outputs fast. A CPU can theoretically do the same, but it takes much longer than the GPU.

<b>Cooling:</b> All components that consume electricity, are generating heat. Because of this reason, you need a cooling unit to prevent damages on the different modules."
