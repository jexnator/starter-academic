## {{< hl >}}<b>Cloud Security in AWS</b>{{< /hl >}}<br>
In this module I will learn about Cloud Security in AWS. Here you will find several tasks or summarizations about the topic.<br>

### {{< hl >}}<b>Section 1: Course Introduction</b>{{< /hl >}}<br>
Security is the practice of safeguarding intellectual property from unauthorized access, use, or modification.

The CIA triad is a fundamental concept in information security, comprising three core principles:
- Confidentiality: Limiting access to information to authorized users and preventing access by unauthorized persons.
- Integrity: Ensuring the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle, including the origin or source of the data.
- Availability: Ensuring that information resources are readily accessible when needed.

The CIA triad faces challenges in modern IT environments due to the large volume of information to be protected, the diverse sources of data, and the variety of formats used.

`Security in the AWS cloud`
AWS tries to make security as familiar as what we are doing day by day. Security is of utmost importance, especially in a cloud environment.
Existing security models used in on-premises environments can be applied to the cloud.
AWS offers various services and tools to enhance security, providing <b>controllability</b>, <b>auditability</b>, and <b>visibility</b> into cloud resources and workloads.
The ability to work in an <b>agile</b> way and <b>automate</b> processes is especially important for incident response.<br>

`Security design principles`<br>
- least privilege
- enable traceability
- secure all layers
- automate security
- protect data in transit and at rest
- prepare for security events
- minimize attack surface

`AWS Well-Architected Framework`
AWS follows the Shared Responsibility model (SRM), where responsibilities are divided between AWS and its customers.
![SRM](srm.jpg "<b> AWS Shared Responsibilty model |</b> Screenshot")

AWS is responsible for safeguarding the global infrastructure that hosts all AWS Cloud services, including hardware, software, networking, and facilities.
As an AWS customer, you can securely provision various resources in the AWS Cloud, such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and desktops.
Customers are responsible for securing their data, operating systems, networks, platforms, and other resources created in the AWS Cloud.
Customers are accountable for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data in the cloud, and for meeting specific business and compliance requirements for their workloads.

The division of responsibilities varies depending on the type of AWS services used, implying different levels of responsibility for AWS and the customers.<br>

### {{< hl >}}<b>Section 2: IaM</b>{{< /hl >}}<br>
`Authentication vs. Authorization`
- Authentication is the process of identifying the users and validating who they claim to be.
- Authorization is the process (after authentication) to give the user access to specific resources (mostly role-based)

`AWS Identity and Access Management (IaM) Recap`
AWS uses IaM for authentication and authorization in the cloud. The following entities are relevant:
- Users: Indentity with long term credentials (pw/access key)
- Groups: A collection of users, apply permissions to a collection of users
- Roles: Identity with short term credentials, can be assumed by entities like users, services, accounts etc.
- Policies: An object in AWS that defines permissions (on AWS resources), can be attached to users, groups and roles

`Amazon Cognito for Authentication`
Amazon Cognito is a service from AWS that provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile applications. It consists of two main components: User Pools and Identity Pools.

A user pool serves as a user directory that manages the login and registration process for an application. Users can sign in either directly through a user pool, or federate through a third-party identity provider (IdP). The main purpose of a user pool is the authentication of users by storing user data and providing users with access tokens. User Pools are not directly associated with AWS resources and do not handle the authorization of AWS services (directly).
![user pool workflow](user-pool.jpg "<b> user pool workflow |</b> Screenshot")

An Identity Pool allows temporary AWS credentials to be assigned to users (authenticated or unauthenticated) for example from a user pool, or other IdPs to grant access to AWS resources. An Identity Pool is focused on authorizing and managing AWS credentials.

|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blogging platform               | User pool                      | A blogging platform where users can write articles, comment and manage their profiles.                                        | A user pool is ideal for handling user registration and authentication. Users can log in, reset their password, and update their profiles. Since the interactions are mainly at the application level and do not require direct AWS permissions, an Identity Pool is not necessary. |
| Guest access to news app        | Identity pool                  | A news app where unauthenticated users (guests) can read articles and watch videos from a media archive.                      | An Identity Pool can be used to grant temporary AWS permissions to guests to access media content in AWS services. Since there is no authentication requirement for access, no user pool is needed.                                                                                 |
| Photo sharing app               | both                           | A mobile photo sharing app where users can upload their photos, which are stored in an S3 bucket, and share them with others. | A User Pool authenticates users and manages their credentials. After successful authentication, the Identity Pool provides temporary AWS permissions that allow the authenticated user to upload or download photos in an S3 bucket.                                                |

### {{< hl >}}<b>Section 3: Detective Controls</b>{{< /hl >}}<br>
`Monitoring Overview`
![Monitoring Overview](monitoring-overview.jpg "<b> AWS Monitoring Overview |</b> Screenshot")

`Amazon GuardDuty for Threat Detection`
Amazon GuardDuty is an intelligent threat detection service for AWS accounts and workloads. It uses threat intelligence and machine learning to detect anomalies and suspicious activities, such as unauthorized deployments. When a threat is found, alerts are sent to the GuardDuty console and AWS CloudWatch Events for integration with existing services or systems.
![GuardDuty detection categories](detection-categories.jpg "<b> GuardDuty detection categories |</b> Screenshot")Â 

`AWS Security Hub for Prioritizing Findings`
AWS Security Hub is a consolidated view of security. It uses different AWS services as inputs (e.g. GuardDuty, Macie, Firewall Manager, etc.). It also support third party insights. In security hub you have the possibility to evaluate the security in the cloud with different securiry standards. The insights and findings can be forwarded to EventBridge for incident responses.
![AWS Security Hub](security-hub.jpg "<b> AWS Security Hub Overview |</b> Screenshot")

`Amazon Macie for Data Monitoring`
Amazon Macie can be used to analyze S3 buckets for sensitive data such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers. It also evaluates whether an S3 bucket is publicly accessible and whether it is encrypted or not. The analyses are be performed as jobs. They can be shedulded on personal preferences. The results can be published to security hub or even to event bridge to take action in an automated way.

### {{< hl >}}<b>Section 4: Infrastructure Protection</b>{{< /hl >}}<br>
`Securing Your Compute Resources`
In AWS you have different opportunities to limit access to resources on the network level. The most common ways are:
- Firewall on the host (e.g. netfilter on linux)
- Security Groups
- Subnet access control lists
- Web application firewall (WAF)
- Network firewall
- ...
![Securing compute resources on AWS](securing-resources.jpg "<b> Securing compute resources on AWS |</b> Screenshot")
Â Â Â 
`WAF for Traffic Filtering`
A web application firewall operates at layer 7 and is capable of filtering the http protocol. The most common method of catching violations is to block requests or block them above a certain threshold. Possible filter rules are:
- filtering based on headers
- Query parameters
- HTTP-Methods
- URI path
- IPs
- http body (e.g. strings, size or SQL injection)

`AWS WAF`
AWS WAF is a Web Application Firewall managed by AWS and is organized in Web Access Control Lists (Web ACLs). Web ACLs can be associated with different AWS services like:
- ALBs
- API Gateways
- AppSync
- CloudFront

After a WAF is associated, every request gets checked based on the configured rules.
Â Â Â 
`AWS Shield for DDoS Protection`
AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards web applications that run on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency.

### {{< hl >}}<b>Section 5: Data Protection</b>{{< /hl >}}<br>
####Â `Amazon S3 spotlight`
Amazon S3 is an object storage service in AWS that enables storage, retrieval, and management of data in the cloud. It uses a flat namespace schema with buckets and keys and provides API access for CRUD operations. It is used for static websites, backups, archiving, and data analytics etc.
-S3 data is fully private to an account, and public access is blocked by default 
- Ability to encrypt your data and have AWS manage the keys

##### `S3 Protection via resource-based policies`
<b>Default Privacy and Access Control:</b>
Amazon S3 resources are private by default, only accessible by the owner. Access can be controlled through policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

<b>Types of Access Control Mechanisms:</b>
Amazon S3 supports two groups of access control: resource-based (bucket policies, bucket ACLs, object ACLs) and user-based (IAM user policies). ACLs grant read or write access to groups of users. Policies enable centralized management.

<b>Bucket Policies:</b>
Bucket policies in Amazon S3 can add or deny permissions within a single bucket. They allow for flexibility in granting access to users within your AWS Account or other AWS accounts, centralizing the control of permissions.

<b>Use cases</b>

Object ACLs:
- Grant access to individual objects
- Access objects owned by another account

Bucket ACLs:
- Grant log delivery group write permissions to bucket

Bucket policies:
- Offer a larger range of permissions than bucket ACLs
- Provide cross-account access to bucket

IAM identity-based policies:
- Manage permissions by creating users and groups and attaching policies

#####Â `S3 Protection via encryption`
`AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for Key Management`Â Â Â Â 
`AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for Securing Communications`Â Â 
`AWS Secrets Manager for Credentials Management`
